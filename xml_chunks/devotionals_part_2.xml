		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Diving deep into theological waters with eternal implications, Pastor Ray Viola shares from Eph. 1:3-5 and asks "who chooses who in salvation" With God's sovereignty and man's responsibility, what does the Bible say about "election and predestination?" This truth will set you free from the extremes that plague the church today on both sides of this debate.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;f you have been a Christian for any length of time, you have more than likely been drawn into the Calvinism vs. Arminianism conversation regarding the method or process of man's salvation. Both systems of interpretation contain 5 points that contain biblical support. Both systems believe and teach the biblical doctrines of election and predestination. But when you read either of their 5 points, you walk away knowing that something is missing.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/84584673"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

According to Scripture, God chooses man before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:3-4; Revelation 13:8, 17:8), but man is also responsible to repent and believe the gospel (Mark 1:15; Acts 2:38, 17:30). So who chooses who? Well, both systems believe that God chooses man and man chooses God. Where they disagree is in the "mechanics" or the "process" of how it happens. They disagree about what God does and when, and what man does and when. Both want you to embrace The Savior and embrace their system. I say, embrace The Savior and forget their systems. No system saves you. We owe our salvation to the electing love and drawing of The Father (Ephesians 1:3-4), the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:7), and the conviction and sealing of The Holy Ghost after hearing and believing the gospel.

We will see in this study that the bible teaches the doctrines of election and predestination. So it is kind of absurd to ask if we at Koinonia believe in election or predestination. Of course we do. God's ways are not our ways (Isaiah 55:8,9). Secret things belong to The Lord (Deuteronomy 29:29). We, being finite, can only see through a glass darkly (1 Corinthians 13:12). A man once asked a staunch Reformed pastor after a message on election if he could know if he were one of the elect. His answer? Absolutely! Repent and believe in The Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. John Wesley couldn't agree more. Today, make your calling and election sure; repent and believe the gospel (Acts 20:21).&lt;em&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;V. 4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.&lt;/b&gt;This is known as the doctrine of election, which is taught throughout Scripture. Through Gods sovereign will before the creation of the world and, therefore, obviously independent of human influence and apart from any human merit, those who are saved have become eternally united with Christ Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Redemption is Gods plan of salvation from everlasting to everlasting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is vitally important that we understand that Gods election or predestination does not operate apart from or nullify mans responsibility to believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior. No one is saved apart from believing personally in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When God opens our blind eyes to see our own guilty condition and also the beauty and glory of the person of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice on the cross, we cease from our efforts to save ourselves. That glimpse of the greatness, majesty and glory of God shows you why you need the Savior. Thus, we cast ourselves totally on Christ.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 4 reveals to us why we were chosen? (1) To be holy and without blame. (2) To be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ (&lt;b&gt;Romans 8.29).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holy.&lt;/b&gt;Set apart for the Master use. This is the same Greek word that is translated saints in verse 1. Gods will for each and every one of His children is that we&lt;b&gt;be holy as He is holy.&lt;/b&gt;Holiness, or sanctification is the will of God for every child of God.RJV Look up cross reference for holiness1 Thess 4.7&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Without blame.&lt;/b&gt;The Greek word that is translated in the KJV&lt;b&gt;without blame&lt;/b&gt;is the same word that is used to describe an acceptable paschal lamb. Jesus Christ, as our paschal lamb, is also said to be unblemished (&lt;b&gt;Heb 9:14; 1 Pet 1:19&lt;/b&gt;). Since believers are in Christ, God views them positionally without blemish as well (&lt;b&gt;Jude 24; Eph 5:27; Col 1:22&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs. 1.5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Vs. 1.6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Many Greek scholars tell us that the phrase&lt;b&gt;in love&lt;/b&gt;at the end of verse 4 should grammatically be placed at the beginning of verse 5, for it reveals the divine motive for Gods elective purpose.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predestinated.&lt;/b&gt;Motivated by love, The Father&lt;b&gt;predestinated&lt;/b&gt;us to be&lt;b&gt;adopted&lt;/b&gt;as His children, by grace through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ,&lt;b&gt;according to the good pleasure of His will&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word that is translated&lt;b&gt;predestined (&lt;/b&gt;Strongs #4309&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;here in verses 5 and 11&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;means&lt;i&gt;to mark out beforehand, to determine before, foreordain;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 4.28 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4309&amp;amp;t=KJV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;G4309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;to be done.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 8.29 For whom He did foreknow he&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4309&amp;amp;t=KJV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;G4309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;also did predestinate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4309&amp;amp;t=KJV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;G4309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to be&lt;/i&gt;conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30.Moreover whom He did predestinateG4309them He also called, and whom He called, them He also justified, and whom He justified, them He also glorified.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 2.7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,&lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt;the hidden&lt;i&gt;wisdom&lt;/i&gt;, which God ordained&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4309&amp;amp;t=KJV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;G4309&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;before the world unto our glory.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Foreknowledge is one aspect of Gods omniscience. His includes His electing grace, but does not preclude human will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adopted.&lt;/b&gt;Adoption as his sons is different from spiritual birth as children. All true believers have been born as children of God. To be adopted as a son means to have the full rights of an heir. Because of this adoption, all believers acknowledge God as Abba or Father.&lt;b&gt;Rom 8.15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is by Gods grace through Christ that&lt;b&gt;we are accepted in The Beloved (Jesus Christ).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the praise of the glory of His grace.&lt;/b&gt;The ultimate purpose of election to salvation is the glory of God. In fact, the entire gospel message and the purpose of the Christian life is that we live for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods love and grace are the originating causes of salvation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The atoning death of Jesus Christ is the meritorious cause. The Spirit of God is the efficient cause. The Word of God is the instrumental cause. Faith is the conditional cause. The glory of God is the final cause.&lt;/i&gt;Thomas Oden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In closing, let me say a few things.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3.14-17 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus referred to the story of&lt;b&gt;Num. 21:59&lt;/b&gt;where the Israelite people who looked at the serpent lifted up by Moses were healed. The point of this illustration or analogy is in the lifted up. Just as Moses lifted up the snake on the pole so that all who looked upon it might live physically, those who look to Christ, who was lifted up on the cross, will live spiritually and eternally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;In our last post we explored the doctrine of election, and now we will look into the doctrine of predestination.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we to look that the spiritual blessings that belong to us who are in Christ Jesus, we read that we are predestinated to be adopted as children by Jesus Christ. The Greek word that is translated predestinated is the Greek Word that means, to mark out beforehand, to determine before, or foreordain. Other than here in Ephesians 1.5 &amp;amp; 11, it is found in Acts 4.28, 1 Corinthians 2.7 and Romans 8.29 &amp;amp; 30. It is clear from each of these passages that the word does not describe an afterthought, but a definite plan.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt; So what was that plan? Unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto Himself. By regeneration, we receive a change of nature from God; by adoption, we become heirs of Christ in the family of God. Every single one of the glorious salvation terms that we find in Scripture, adoption, redemption, justification, regeneration, sanctification etc. are all in Christ Jesus (cp. 1 Cor 1.30).&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt; Thus, the eternal and unchanging plan of God belongs only to those who are in Christ Jesus. So how on earth (no pun intended) does one get into Christ Jesus? In Romans 16.7, Paul refers to people who were in Christ before me. Huh? I thought we were all in Christ before the foundation of the world. Yes, that is true. But the fact is that nobody is born in Christ, we are all born in Adam. Thus, to get into Christ, God commands all men (how many might that be?) everywhere (where might that be?) to repent.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt; When the gospel is proclaimed, we are commanded to repent and believe on The Lord Jesus Christ. It is after we hear the gospel and believe that we are sealed by the Spirit (Eph 1.13,14). That is when we become sons of God and cry unto Him, Abba Father (Rom 8.15).&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

We saw last time in verse 3 that the Holy Spirit inspires Paul to begin this beautiful section of Scripture on election and predestination by saying &lt;b&gt;blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;He begins by saying that the God Who has elected us and predestined us is good. Jesus said, &lt;b&gt;there is none good but One, that is God (Matt 19.17). &lt;/b&gt;The Psalmist would say, that &lt;b&gt;He is good and His mercy endures forever. &lt;/b&gt;Our God is good beloved! The God Who loves us and grants us salvation is a good God.

God The Father hath blessed us, (&lt;b&gt;the saints &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;faithful in Christ Jesus) &lt;/b&gt;with &lt;b&gt;all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;Please note that all spiritual blessings that we have from God The Father are in Christ Jesus, be it &lt;b&gt;wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption (1 Cor 1.30). Of Him are we in Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thus every spiritual blessing that we are given is in Christ Jesus and only belongs to those who are in Him. Christ is &lt;b&gt;the elect of God (Isa 42.1), the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world (Rev 13.8)&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus is the &lt;b&gt;chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded (1 Peter 2.6). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We know that we are &lt;b&gt;chosen in Him before the foundation of the world, &lt;/b&gt;but the $64,000 question this side of eternity is &lt;i&gt;how do we get in Christ on earth&lt;/i&gt;? The answer? We get in Christ &lt;b&gt;after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in Whom, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise (Eph 1.13,14).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We were chosen by The Father before the foundation of the world in eternity past. (4-6)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We talked about the meaning of the word chosen and how it means that &lt;i&gt;God freely and independently, unaffected by any human work, or any human choice chose us to be included in His Son Jesus Christ. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We were redeemed by Jesus Christs atonement on the cross in our historical past. (7-12)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We were sealed into Christ after we heard the gospel and believed in our personal past. (13,14)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As far as Paul was concerned, the proof that the Ephesians were chosen by God was that Paul &lt;b&gt;heard of their faith in The Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints (Eph 1.15). &lt;/b&gt;This is exactly what we read in &lt;b&gt;1 John. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I am not saying that man makes salvation happen, because that is not what the Bible teaches. It is all Gods grace. It is Gods gospel. I am simply stating that there is no salvation recorded in Scripture &lt;i&gt;in this life &lt;/i&gt;that is apart from the preaching of the gospel being mixed with repentance of sin and faith in the crucifixion, burial and resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No question about it, it is God Who gives us a new heart and gives us new life, but He doesnt do it before we are born again. The means that He uses is the proclamation of the gospel. &lt;b&gt;We are born again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. (1 Peter 1.23-25). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We stated that the reason that we are chosen to be &lt;b&gt;holy. &lt;/b&gt;We talked about the heresy of the gospel message that never mentions the word sin, or the need for repentance. The reason why we are chosen is to be holy or set apart for The Masters use with the progressive evidence of sanctification in the life of the believer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We mentioned that our position in Christ is that we are &lt;b&gt;without blame before Him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I then mentioned the 2 main systems of theology that describe what God does and when and what man does and when as being Arminiansim and Calvinism. In between A and C is B, the Bible.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I truly believe that neither system fully explains the tension that exists in Scripture between Gods divine purposes and mans responsibility in the matters of salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ive read both A &amp;amp; C books on systems of theology, and both have appendixes that explain passages that are difficult to understand according to their systems.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, each system has their list of Scriptures that prove their position to be true and biblically sound.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I believe that there is truth in both systems. Personally, I would never come to either full-blown conclusion that endorses either system by reading the Scripture alone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I embrace my precious Arminian friends and I embrace my precious Calvinist friends.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, do not let anybody tell you that you have to be either A or C to be a Christian. Scripture does not say repent and become Presbyterian or Baptist or Koinonian!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No religious system or system of theology in and of itself has the power to save you. Christ is the power of The Gospel. Only faith in the crucified, risen, exalted and glorified Lord Jesus Christ saves you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Jesus is life, not in any "ism". Whenever you mix Jesus with any "ism", the "ism" becomes the focus and Jesus inevitably takes the back seat.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of my dear Reformed pastor friends told me over lunch that he would rather be in a live Arminian church than a dead Calvinist one.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"&lt;i&gt;I wish I'd known that people who disagree with me on doctrines I hold dearly can often love God and pursue his glory with as much, and in some cases more, fervency than I do. The sort of intellectual pride that fuels such delusions can be devastating to ministry and will invariably undermine any efforts at broader Christian unity across denominational lines&lt;/i&gt;." Sam Storms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So now lets move on to verse 5 and 6 and the doctrine of predestination and adoption.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would be impossible to be a Bible-believing Christian without affirming God's electing grace and having a doctrine of election. The same could be said about predestination, often thought of as a synonym for election.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And it can safely be said that people's election is God's grace, not human achievement. Nowhere does the Bible even hint that people elect themselves. Man cannot save themselves. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even historical Arminianism believes that sinners receive what is known as prevenient grace.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prevenient grace is grace that convicts, calls, illumines, and enables a person to repent and believe on The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christian theologians disagree about whether it is resistible or irresistible, but all evangelical theologians agree it is necessary for the first exercise of a good will toward God. Jesus is The Author and Finisher of our faith. Its all of grace from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs.5 In love, having predestinated us (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;for what purpose?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of His will (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Whos will?). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in The Beloved.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Predestination&lt;/b&gt;- G4309.  &lt;i&gt;proorizo&lt;/i&gt;; from 4253 and 3724; &lt;i&gt;to limit in advance&lt;/i&gt;, i. e. (figuratively) &lt;i&gt;predetermine&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;determine before, ordain, predestinate&lt;/i&gt;. This Greek word is used here in &lt;b&gt;Eph 1.5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11. &lt;/b&gt;It is also found in 4 other places in Scripture:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 4.28 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;determined before&lt;/span&gt; G4309 to be done.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 2.7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;ordained&lt;/span&gt; G4309 before the world unto our glory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In what is known as the golden thread of redemption, we read &lt;b&gt;in Romans 8.29,30 For whom he did foreknow, he also did &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;predestinate&lt;/span&gt; (G4309) (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;why?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;predestinate&lt;/span&gt; (G4309), them he also called (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;chosen, elected&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;): and whom he called, them he also justified (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;declared right&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;): and whom he justified, them he also glorified.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Foreknowledge- &lt;/b&gt;Vines-proginosko (, 4267), &lt;i&gt;to know before&lt;/i&gt; (pro, &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt;, ginosko, &lt;i&gt;to know&lt;/i&gt;),
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This word is used in Scripture to describe divine knowledge, concerning &lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; Christ, &lt;b&gt;1 Pet. 1:20&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Who verily was &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;foreordained&lt;/span&gt; before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;2) &lt;/b&gt;Israel as Gods earthly people, &lt;b&gt;Rom. 11:2&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;God hath not cast away His people which He &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;foreknew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(3)&lt;/b&gt; believers, &lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:29&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But this word is also use to describe human knowledge, (&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; of persons&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;In&lt;b&gt; Acts 26:5&lt;/b&gt;, Paul talks about fellow Jews &lt;b&gt;which &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;knew me&lt;/span&gt; from the beginning&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; of facts, &lt;b&gt;2 Pet. 3:17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To &lt;i&gt;know beforehand&lt;/i&gt; speaks of knowing in a special or intimate way.

It is used this way in &lt;b&gt;Amos 3:2: You only have I known of all the families of the earth.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This of course reveals how God set His electing love on the nation of Israel. This means that God knows or has a special love for the nation of Israel. This does not mean that God did not know other nations existed, it means that He knew Israel in a special way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On a personal level, to know someone in a special or intimate way is also used in Scripture. God told Jeremiah &lt;b&gt;I knew you before you were in your mothers womb (Jer 1.5). &lt;/b&gt;Cp. &lt;b&gt;Luke 1.15; Gal 1.15.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Passages that talk about God's special or intimate love for His elect, either Israel or the church, do not negate passages that talk about God's love for the stranger or non-Israelite in the OT or His love for the world in the NT (&lt;b&gt;John 3.16&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Passages that talk about particular atonement for God's elect do not negate passages of a Scripture that speak of Christs sacrifice for the sins of the world (&lt;b&gt;2 Cor 5.19-21; 1 Tim 2.4;Heb 2.9; 1 John 2.2&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The only people who have problems with opposite truths of Scripture are those who only see the passages through the lens of their systematic proof text lists. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thus, in every system of theology, words break down and fall short somewhere. Let me give you lone example. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Such is the case with the word &lt;b&gt;called &lt;/b&gt;used in the Golden thread of redemption passages in &lt;b&gt;Romans 8.29,30, &lt;/b&gt;which refers to those who are &lt;b&gt;predestinated, justified and glorified. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Matt 22.1-14&lt;/b&gt; Jesus is teaching about the king (Jehovah) who prepares a wedding feast for his son (Jesus). The same Greek word that is translated &lt;b&gt;called &lt;/b&gt;in &lt;b&gt;Romans 8.30 &lt;/b&gt;is translated &lt;b&gt;call&lt;/b&gt; vs.3; &lt;b&gt;bidden&lt;/b&gt;, vs. 4,8; &lt;b&gt;bid &lt;/b&gt;vs.9), and refers to Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Israel was &lt;b&gt;called &lt;/b&gt;to the wedding feast, but only a few are chosen. They were as &lt;b&gt;called&lt;/b&gt; to the wedding feast as those who are &lt;b&gt;predestinated&lt;/b&gt; were &lt;b&gt;called&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Romans 8.30. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;were all who were &lt;b&gt;called &lt;/b&gt;to the wedding&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the teaching of Jesus chosen to attend? According to Jesus, those who are chosen are not simply those who are called, they are those who embraced Him as Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So Gods foreknowledge involves His electing grace, and intimate love, but this does not preclude the commandment given to men to repent and believe the gospel.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Predestination &lt;/b&gt;is Gods Grace at work before the foundation of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Calling &lt;/b&gt;is Gods Grace confronting us.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Justification &lt;/b&gt;is Gods Grace making us right w/Himself in the midst of history.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Glorification &lt;/b&gt;is Gods Grace in the consummation of this age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A word about predestination:

&lt;b&gt;Predestination &lt;/b&gt;is never used in reference to unsaved people. God has never predestinated anybody to be lost. Predestination is not fatalism. Double predestination is not taught in the bible.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ezekiel 18.23 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live?Ezekiel 18.32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [yourselves], and live ye. &lt;/b&gt;Note God says that He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He exhorts them to repent. Sound familiar?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Peter 3.9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The bible says in &lt;b&gt;Matthew 25.41, depart from Me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. &lt;/b&gt;Who was hell created for?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Hell was not created for man, but multitudes of mankind end up there for all eternity. If you are eternally lost, it is because you have rejected the gospel of His dear Son as the only way of salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yes, God created hell and He created people who will go to hell, but God did not create people to go to hell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus tells His disciples, &lt;b&gt;I go to prepare a place for you (John 14.3). &lt;/b&gt;Who is Jesus talking about? His disciples, those Who believe that He and He alone is &lt;b&gt;The Way, The Truth and The Life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;He that believeth (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;adheres to; trusts in; relies upon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to disbelieve willfully and perversely&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him (John 3.36)&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Predestination &lt;/b&gt;is a biblical term of absolute assurance for those who know Jesus Christ as Lord&lt;b&gt;. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them (there is that word know again), and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand (John 10:2728). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking ahead in Ephesians 1.13-15, we will see that &lt;/b&gt;His sheep, are those who hear and believe the word of truth and are sealed with The Holy Spirit of promise forever. They are individuals who love Jesus Christ and all others who call upon His Name.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have taken some time to talk about these things because there are some people who have the idea that if I am elected and predestinated, then God will just zap me and it is going to happen. Beloved, God uses means to call people to salvation, and once you hear the gospel, you are responsible to obey or disobey.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I believe that we can disagree without being disagreeable. I do not believe that we can disagree and be divisive. Being divisive is the flesh (&lt;b&gt;Gal 5.19&lt;/b&gt;). The word &lt;b&gt;sedition&lt;/b&gt; means to be dissension or division. &lt;b&gt;Heresies&lt;/b&gt; means, &lt;i&gt;dissensions arising from diversity of opinions and aims. &lt;/i&gt;This is why Paul called the Corinthians carnal when they were divided over Paul, Apollos and Cephas. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To the praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in The Beloved. &lt;/b&gt;

By Gods grace and according to His sovereign plan, we are &lt;b&gt;adopted&lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;accepted in The Beloved.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Justitification- &lt;i&gt;change of standing before God. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Regeneration- &lt;i&gt;change of nature from God. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repentance- &lt;i&gt;change of mind about God. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conversion- &lt;i&gt;change of life for God. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sanctification- &lt;i&gt;change of service to God&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Glorification- &lt;i&gt;change of place with God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adoption- &lt;i&gt;change of family in God&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By regeneration, we enter into the kingdom of God. By adoption, we becomes heirs of all that God has given to Jesus.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 8:14-17,23 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified together. 23 And not only [they], but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;While regeneration refers to being spiritually reborn into the family of God, the concept of adoption refers to being included in a family one was not born into.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the praise of the glory of His grace. &lt;/b&gt;It is by Gods grace through Christ that we are &lt;b&gt;accepted (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gr. Endued with special favor; highly honored&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) in The Beloved (Jesus Christ).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ultimate purpose of election to salvation is &lt;b&gt;to the praise of the glory of His grace&lt;/b&gt;. In fact, the entire gospel message and the purpose of the Christian life is that we live for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods love and grace are the originating and finishing causes of salvation. The atoning death of Jesus Christ is the meritorious cause. The Spirit of God is the efficient cause. The Word of God is the instrumental cause. Faith is the hand that reaches out to receive it. The glory of God is the final cause&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Matt 22.11 And when the king came in to see the guests, He saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: 12 And He saith unto him, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. 13, Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 14 For many are called, but few are chosen&lt;/b&gt;

RJV wedding garmentsworks, religion are the unacceptable garments.

&lt;i&gt;The doctrine of election has been pictured in this way. Here is a vast host of people hurrying down the broad road with their minds fixed on their sins, and one person stands calling attention to a door- the entrance into the narrow way that leads to life eternal. On this door is plainly written the text, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whosoever will, let him come&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Every man is invited, no one need hesitate. Some may say, Well, I may not be of the elect, and so it would be useless for me to endeavor to come, for the door will not open for me. But Gods invitation is absolutely sincere: it is addressed to every man&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/?q=re+22:17&amp;amp;t=en_nas&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revelation 22:17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;If men refuse to come, if they pursue their own godless way down to the pit, whom can they blame but themselves for their eternal judgment? The messenger addressed himself to all, the call comes to all, the door could be entered by all, but many refuse to come and perish in their sins. Such men can never blame God for their eternal destruction. The door was open, the invitation was given, they refused. God says to them sorrowfully, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. But as the invitation is extended, every minute or two someone stops and asks, What is that? The way to life, is the reply. Ah, that I might find the way to life! I have found no satisfaction in this old world. I should like to know how to be free from my sin, how to be made fit for the presence of God. Then he draws near and listens, and the Spirit of God impresses the message on his heart and conscience. As a result he says, I am going inside: I will accept the invitation; I will enter that door, and he presses his way in and it shuts behind him. As he turns about he finds written on the inside of the door the words, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;. What? he says, had God His heart fixed on me before ever the world came into being? Yes, but he could not find it out until he got inside. You see, you can pass the door if you will, you can trample the love of God beneath your feet, you can spurn His grace if you are determined to do it, but you will go down to the pit and you will be responsible for your own doom.&lt;/i&gt;

If people are troubled by the doctrine of predestination and worried about whether or not they are saved, they should look at the wounds of the crucified Christ. There they will see what they need to know, what God has revealed  that God loves sinners enough to die for them  and they will be comforted. -Luther

The great English Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon, saved in a Methodist church but a passionate Calvinist, frequently prayed a seemingly inconsistent prayer at his church's evening prayer meetings: "God, call out your elect. And then elect some more."

Come today, come now; repent and receive Christ as Lord.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Being chosen, being for-known, and being adopted could only happen in one way...by the blood of Jesus! Our good works, our ceremonies, our social programs, and our religious observations could never make us "right" in the scales of God's justice...every soul needs the finished work of Christ on the cross to bridge the gape between a holy God and sinful man. Have you received this forgives or are you still trusting in what you can do? Trust Jesus today.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/85682060"&gt;
&lt;img class="alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

I am going to ask you a question and then answer it for you. How about that? According to Gods Word, what is your greatest need today? The greatest need of every person, whether he recognizes it or not, is to have God forgive his or her sins before he or she dies in order to avert Gods eternal punishment. That forgiveness of sin is more important than anything else was clearly revealed when Jesus forgave the man sick of the palsy before He healed him physically.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Any needs for health, finances, or any of the many other personal or family matters are important indeed, but if you die without Gods forgiveness, these blessings are only temporal but eternally useless. &lt;i&gt;Your greatest need is to know that God has forgiven your sins and that you are reconciled to the holy Judge of the universe. &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Vs. 1.7 In whom we have redemption (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;how?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) through his blood, the forgiveness of sins (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this is what His blood accomplishes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), according to the riches of his grace (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the source of our redemption is the grace of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;); &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Whom we have redemption&lt;/b&gt;- lets not allow the necessary, but heady and academic discussions regarding the doctrines of predestination and election that we have looked into over the past few weeks overshadow The Person and work o Our Lord Jesus Christ. Our redemption is in Christ. The volume of the book is written about Jesus, Who took upon Himself human form to become our Passover Lamb.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is in Christ that&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are chosen (v. 4), adopted (v. 5), redeemed and forgiven (v. 7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.8 Wherein (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;his grace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A mystery in the bible is something that was hidden in the OT that has been revealed in the NT. That the Gentiles should ever be received into the Church of God, and have all the privileges of the Jews, without being obliged to submit to circumcision, and perform the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law was a mystery hidden in ages past, but now revealed to the apostles (&lt;b&gt;Eph 3.5&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is the mystery spoken of in chapters 3 and 5. Jew and Gentile joined together in the body of Jesus Christ, Messiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is by the grace of God that we have been made known he mystery of His will concerning the redemption and salvation of poor lost sinners, both Jews and Gentiles by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ Jesus alone. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even in Him- &lt;/b&gt;Paul uses the language of in Christ or in him or in the Lord Jesus roughly 40 times in Ephesians. The whole of our salvation can be summed up with reference to this reality that we are in Christ. It is in Christ that at the end of the ages, all things will be gathered together (v. 10).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the praise of his glory&lt;/b&gt;. Gods glory is the supreme purpose in Christ for those who trust in Him (cf. vv. 6 14). Our entire blessednessour victory, our happiness, our hopeis to intended to manifest the greatness, wonder and grace of God in and through our lives.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 6.20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://av1611.com/verseclick/gobible.php?p=1%20Corinthians_7.23"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 7:23&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As we hold the bread and the cup this morning, our hearts are to remember that the measure of Gods forgiveness is according to the riches of His grace, which He has lavished on us in and through Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Redemption&lt;/b&gt;  Gr. &lt;i&gt;Apolutrosis&lt;/i&gt; refers to a &lt;i&gt;releasing, deliverance or liberation that is obtained by the payment of a ransom&lt;/i&gt;. So &lt;b&gt;the forgiveness of sin &lt;/b&gt;that we have in Christ Jesus is a legal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;payment or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;remission of that debt that each one of us owe to God on account of our offences, because of which our liability to punishment is cancelled&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10 uses of apolutrosis in the NT. Let me read to you a few of them so that we get a biblical understanding of how this word is used. idea or
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom 3.24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1.14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the forgiveness of sins:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 9.12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption &lt;i&gt;for us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So this redemption that we speak of is a once and for all sacrifice that is free, it is by Gods grace, it is through His shed blood on the cross that has been brought by Jesus into the very holy place in heaven and it is eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isa 60.16 I the LORD &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Job prophesied the Incarnation of Jesus Christ when he declared, &lt;b&gt;For I know &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; my redeemer liveth, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; he shall stand at the latter &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt; upon the earth. Job 19.25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Jesus said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that &lt;b&gt;He came to give His life a ransom&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3083"&gt;&lt;i&gt;lutron&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;b&gt;for many&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Mark%2010.45"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark 10:45&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matthew%2020.28"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 20:28&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3083"&gt;Lutron&lt;/a&gt; is common in the papyri as the purchase-money in freeing slaves.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You and I use words such as redeemer or redemption as religious terms. But when a person back in the first century heard these terms, he or she immediately thought in non-religious terms. It brought to mind the common picture of a slave being purchased and then set free. &lt;i&gt;Redemption meant that I was released from bondage by the payment of a price made by someone else. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This precious word redemption is a word that has roots in the Old Testament. For example, it is a word that refers to a kinsman-redeemer. In the Book of Ruth, Naomis family property, due to debt, had fallen into other hands. Because she had lost her husband, she could not afford to recover it. Boaz was a near relative who had the right to redeem the property by paying the price, which he did.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In another Old Testament context, God is seen as the one who redeemed Israel from bondage in Egypt (&lt;b&gt;Exod. 6:6&lt;/b&gt;). As you know, the Jews had to put the blood of the Passover lamb on the lintel and doorposts of their homes. God then said, &lt;b&gt;and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both the Exodus out of Egypt and the Boaz redemption of the property of Naomi and Ruth were OT pictures of our redemption through the blood of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Why blood, one might ask?&lt;b&gt; Hebrews 9:22&lt;/b&gt; states plainly, &lt;b&gt;without the shedding of blood there is no remission &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;or forgiveness of sin&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This of course takes us back to &lt;b&gt;Leviticus 17:11&lt;/b&gt;, where God explains, &lt;b&gt;For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All of those&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;animal sacrifices pointed ahead to Jesus, the Lamb of God, who by His death redeemed all who come to the Father through Him. Thus, God can be &lt;b&gt;just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:26).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Satan is the master of sowing confusion about Gods forgiveness under the guise of religion. Every single non-Christian world religion, every cult and every alleged Christian church that teaches that we must do somethingfasting, prayer, penance, self- denial, good worksto help pay for our sins and to earn Gods favor is accursed.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gal 1.6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 1.7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 1.8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 1.9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
My friend, if you try to seek Gods forgiveness in any way other than through the &lt;b&gt;redemption that is in Christ Jesus, &lt;/b&gt;you will remain unconverted and your eternal soul is in grave danger. If your hope of heaven rests on anything that you must do to earn it, than you today are as lost and lost can be no matter how many good works you perform.

Likewise, if you are claiming to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, but there is no evidence of the fruit of a new birth in your life, you may very well be one of those people to whom The Master will say, &lt;b&gt;I never knew you; depart from Me&lt;/b&gt;.

According to Scripture, each and every person here this morning was born into this world helplessly, hopelessly enslaved to sin and under Gods just condemnation. But with the shedding of His own blood, Jesus Christ, by the gracious plan of God, &lt;b&gt;tasted death for every man&lt;/b&gt;. Implicit in the biblical doctrine of redemption by grace through faith is that &lt;i&gt;God does something for us that we could not do for ourselves&lt;/i&gt;. We were enslaved to sin and like the debtor in &lt;b&gt;Matthew 18&lt;/b&gt;; we have no power or means to free ourselves.

The gospel of the grace of God reveals that God does not require or need our help in paying the price. In fact, it is an insult to Christ if we think that we can add anything of our own to the great price that He paid. Remember that Jesus said on the cross, &lt;b&gt;it is finished &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;John 19.30&lt;/b&gt;).

Would you please note that in verse 7 Paul does not say, &lt;i&gt;In Him, someday we hope to be redeemed&lt;/i&gt;. Nor does he say, &lt;i&gt;Were working at obtaining redemption, but we dont know yet if well get it until we see whether our good works tip the scale&lt;/i&gt;. Rather, he says, &lt;b&gt;In Him, we have redemption&lt;/b&gt;. In other words, biblical redemption is our current possession and experience. True, we await the future redemption of our bodies (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:23&lt;/b&gt;). True, the finalization of our redemption will not occur until Jesus returns (&lt;b&gt;Luke 21:28&lt;/b&gt;). But those glorious promises only apply to those who are in Christ today.

There is no redemption anywhere outside of Jesus Christ. There is no redemption in either Protestantism or Catholicism. There is no redemption in Calvinism or Arminianism.

There is only redemption by grace, through faith in Christ Jesus because redemption means that Christ and Christ alone had paid the price to free us from the penalty and power of sin.

What is salvation? Not a creed. You say, "Well, I believe the plan of salvation." You can believe the plan of salvation and go straight to hell. You're not saved by the plan of salvation, you're saved by the man of salvation.

Salvation is not a creed. It's not a code. You say, "Well, I believe if you live right you'll go to heaven." If you could be saved by living right, then Calvary was a blunder. It's not a cause. You say, "I'm a member of a good, fundamental, Bible believing church." It's not any of these things. It's Christ.

Salvation is not believing something, it is receiving Someone. The true gospel is one that centers in Jesus Christ.

So as we come to the Lords table, we can say in a sense that today is a day of reckoning for each person here in this room. Make your calling and election sure.

		<title>Thoughts on the Bill Nye-Ken Ham evolution debate</title>

		<ns3:encoded>As I was watching the much anticipated debate between Bill Nye and Ken Ham, I found myself feeling compassion for Mr. Nye.

[caption id="attachment_473" align="alignright" width="229"]&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/promo-materials.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-473" alt="Watch a recording of the debate at https://www.debatelive.org" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/promo-materials.jpg" width="229" height="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Watch a recording of the debate at &lt;a href="https://www.debatelive.org"&gt;https://www.debatelive.org&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

There was no question in my mind where I stood on the issue as a Christian before the debate began, but I wanted to hear a recognized proponent of science and evolution speak for themselves first hand. Regardless of what side of the debate a person is on, there can be no challenging the fact that they represent two entirely different world views.

Mr. Nyes worldview is man-centered, science-exalting and void of any power to change the heart of man. By rejecting the Bible as being the Word of God, he cannot offer any real answers to why the universe or man exists. I could not help but think of how Paul told Timothy to avoid profane and vain babbling and oppositions. In other words, turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge.&lt;!--more--&gt;

As Mr. Nye was explaining away the possibility of Noah and his family building the ark to survive the so-called worldwide flood, he left out one very important factor. He left The Almighty out of the equation and His ability to give supernatural knowledge and strength to chosen vessels to accomplish His will.

I wonder if Mr. Nye would deny that Adam and Eve were real people? I wonder if he would believe that Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and spent three days in the belly of the great fish? If so, then it is not if we believe Mr. Ham, as he so often stated, but are we going to believe Bill Nye or Jesus Christ?

I choose to unashamedly believe and proclaim the Word of God and the glorious heart-changing gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ!

Bottom line is this: "In the beginning, God " There it is. Slam dunk! This is Gods universe, and the heavens declare His glory, not ours.

To think of a Christ-less world and all of the fruit that has come directly or indirectly because of what Jesus taught would be devastating. My heart leaped for joy whenever Ken Ham shared the Scriptures and the gospel of Jesus Christ. Job 38-40 knocks every mortal man, saved or unsaved out of the water. God is God, we are not, and I can assure you that there is no debate whatsoever in heaven about Who created what and how long it took.

How do we know? He told us so and He was the Only One there in the beginning. 1 Tim 6.20; Psalm 19, Gen 1.1.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Nye-Ham evolution debate - Afterthoughts</title>

		<ns3:encoded>I promise not to drag this debate topic out after today, but I cannot avoid making a few observations in light of the numerous exchanges between people, both Christian nod non-Christian, on various social media sites. As a Christian, the bible tells me that the heavens (and all of creation for that matter) declares the glory of God. Thus, according to God, one would think that the any "reasonable man's" (a word used by Bill Nye many times) pursuit of scientific discovery in any field would be to confirm, not deny, the existence, glory and majesty of The Almighty. The bible declares that Christ made all things, both visible and invisible. It also declares that He made this material universe out of nothing. Honestly, does that sound reasonable? Do any of the miracles recorded in Scripture sound reasonable?

[caption id="attachment_473" align="alignright" width="229"]&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/promo-materials.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-473" alt="Watch a recording of the debate at https://www.debatelive.org" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/promo-materials.jpg" width="229" height="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Watch a recording of the debate at &lt;a href="https://www.debatelive.org"&gt;https://www.debatelive.org&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

I suggest to you that when you eliminate The Almighty from the equation of the Genesis record of creation, and try to bring the mind and power of God into a laboratory in order to discover how or when the universe came into existence, you will be laid in the balances of reason and found wanting. How does one look at the various and complex forms of plant life or animal life and walk away saying, "glory to the natural processes of evolution?" How does any reasonable person watch a sunrise or sunset or see a baby develop in the womb of their mother and not see the sovereign hand of The Almighty?&lt;!--more--&gt;

From a purely scientific perspective, please explain to me, how does energy or matter evolve into intelligence or conscience? I think one needs more "faith" to deny the existence of God than believe His Word. In my opinion, any science or education that leaves God out of their thinking is futile and ultimately of no moral value to mankind at all. Yes, we may be blessed with discoveries of medicine and technical things that either improves or makes our lives easier; but I believe that it was The Living God Himself Who put those ideas or brains into those people to make those discoveries happen. Thus, glory to God! This may hurt a bit, but Psalm 14 and 51 declare that only a fool would say in their heart there is no God.

As I said yesterday, my heart goes out to Bill Nye, the science guy. According to a Scripture, he is Bill Nye, the lost guy. While it is interesting to engage in the discussion about origins of life, and I would really enjoy hearing a discussion between a secular evolutionist and a born again, Spirit filled, world class scientist, let us never forget that Jesus said to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. I do believe that Ken Ham took the opportunity to do that. People may claim to be agnostic or atheists on earth, but there are no atheists or agnostics in hell. Pray for Bill Nye. Pray the revelation that God gave Simon Peter would one day be his: You are the Christ, The Son of a The Living God.</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>Thanks Pastor Ray for these thoughts; the social ramifications of an evolutionary world view run much deeper than time allotted for discussion, but at the end of the day we all must pray that God opens Bill's heart. Thanks for sharing with us!</ns0:comment_content>

			<ns0:comment_content>Evolution makes no claims about the existence of god(s). It merely sums up our accumulated scientific knowledge to explain what happened after the big bang (or whatever you may choose to call it).

But I don't doubt scientists for millennia have tried to prove existence of god(s). It seems very telling that none have succeeded.</ns0:comment_content>

			<ns0:comment_content>It seems rather sad that Mr. Nye kept asking for any prediction, any proof of anything that will occur in the future proving that there is actually a God behind creation. I was very surprised that Mr. Ham did not alert him that one day even Bill Nye will have to bow before the Lord. I find it to be the ultimate irony that a scientist who bases his work on observation, experimentation, and even the simplest of scientific models cannot admit that casting lures into space will never provide the answers he is unable to find by observing creation. God is everywhere. He is just being ignored.</ns0:comment_content>

			<ns0:comment_content>It's interesting that the main stumbling block in such debates isn't fundamentally evolution. It's always Noah and the arc, or Jonah. They are such difficult scenarios for the average mind to accept that creation is then lumped into the same perceived "impossibility." It would be simpler if these two seemingly impossible accounts had not been the way later events were made possible, and more credible events had occurred. With God, nothing is impossible; however, to the unbelieving mind, faith is a foreign concept. These events cannot be taken as truth by an unbelieving mind, thus, creation loses its foundation. Our faith IS our foundation. Without faith in these early events, the virgin birth and resurrection are, likewise, impossible to accept, and Jesus becomes a "teacher" rather than God. Faith, not proof.... We call this our faith, because that's what it has to be. Creation is so much easier to believe than the problems related to evolution. And just as some can't accept an arc, I can't accept "nothing exploding and creating the Universe." Now, there's a leap of faith making the arc account solid as a rock. (Or should I say, solid as MY rock?)</ns0:comment_content>

		<title>Ephesians 1:7-12, part two</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>I am going to ask you a question and then answer it for you. How about that? According to Gods Word, what is your greatest need today? The greatest need of every person here today, whether he recognizes it or not, is to have God forgive his or her sins before he or she dies in order to avert Gods eternal punishment. That forgiveness of sin is more important than anything else was clearly revealed when Jesus forgave the man sick of the palsy before He healed him physically.

Any needs for health, finances, or any of the many other personal or family matters are important indeed, but if you die without Gods forgiveness, these blessings are only temporal but eternally useless. &lt;i&gt;Your greatest need is to know that God has forgiven your sins and that you are reconciled to the holy Judge of the universe. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Vs. 1.7 In whom we have redemption (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;how?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) through his blood, the forgiveness of sins (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this is what His blood accomplishes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), according to the riches of his grace (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the source of our redemption is the grace of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;); &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Whom we have redemption&lt;/b&gt;- lets not allow the necessary, but heady and academic discussions regarding the doctrines of predestination and election that we have looked into over the past few weeks overshadow The Person and work o Our Lord Jesus Christ. Our redemption is in Christ. The volume of the book is written about Jesus, Who took upon Himself human form to become our Passover Lamb.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is in Christ that&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are chosen (v. 4), adopted (v. 5), redeemed and forgiven (v. 7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.8 Wherein (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;his grace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A mystery in the bible is something that was hidden in the OT that has been revealed in the NT. That the Gentiles should ever be received into the Church of God, and have all the privileges of the Jews, without being obliged to submit to circumcision, and perform the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish law was a mystery hidden in ages past, but now revealed to the apostles (&lt;b&gt;Eph 3.5&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is the mystery spoken of in chapters 3 and 5. Jew and Gentile joined together in the body of Jesus Christ, Messiah.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is by the grace of God that we have been made known he mystery of His will concerning the redemption and salvation of poor lost sinners, both Jews and Gentiles by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ Jesus alone. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even in Him- &lt;/b&gt;Paul uses the language of in Christ or in him or in the Lord Jesus roughly 40 times in Ephesians. The whole of our salvation can be summed up with reference to this reality that we are in Christ. It is in Christ that at the end of the ages, all things will be gathered together (v. 10).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.12 That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;To the praise of his glory&lt;/b&gt;. Gods glory is the supreme purpose in Christ for those who trust in Him (cf. vv. 6 14). Our entire blessednessour victory, our happiness, our hopeis to intended to manifest the greatness, wonder and grace of God in and through our lives.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 6.20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://av1611.com/verseclick/gobible.php?p=1%20Corinthians_7.23"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 7:23&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As we hold the bread and the cup, our hearts are to remember that the measure of Gods forgiveness is according to the riches of His grace, which He has lavished on us in and through Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Redemption&lt;/b&gt;  Gr. &lt;i&gt;Apolutrosis&lt;/i&gt; refers to a &lt;i&gt;releasing, deliverance or liberation that is obtained by the payment of a ransom&lt;/i&gt;. So &lt;b&gt;the forgiveness of sin &lt;/b&gt;that we have in Christ Jesus is a legal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;payment or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;remission of that debt that each one of us owe to God on account of our offences, because of which our liability to punishment is cancelled&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10 uses of apolutrosis in the NT. Let me read to you a few of them so that we get a biblical understanding of how this word is used. idea or
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom 3.24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1.14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; the forgiveness of sins:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 9.12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption &lt;i&gt;for us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So this redemption that we speak of is a once and for all sacrifice that is free, it is by Gods grace, it is through His shed blood on the cross that has been brought by Jesus into the very holy place in heaven and it is eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isa 60.16 I the LORD &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Job prophesied the Incarnation of Jesus Christ when he declared, &lt;b&gt;For I know &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; my redeemer liveth, and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; he shall stand at the latter &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt; upon the earth. Job 19.25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Jesus said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that &lt;b&gt;He came to give His life a ransom&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3083"&gt;&lt;i&gt;lutron&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;b&gt;for many&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Mark%2010.45"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark 10:45&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matthew%2020.28"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 20:28&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=3083"&gt;Lutron&lt;/a&gt; is common in the papyri as the purchase-money in freeing slaves.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You and I use words such as redeemer or redemption as religious terms. But when a person back in the first century heard these terms, he or she immediately thought in non-religious terms. It brought to mind the common picture of a slave being purchased and then set free. &lt;i&gt;Redemption meant that I was released from bondage by the payment of a price made by someone else. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This precious word redemption is a word that has roots in the Old Testament. For example, it is a word that refers to a kinsman-redeemer. In the Book of Ruth, Naomis family property, due to debt, had fallen into other hands. Because she had lost her husband, she could not afford to recover it. Boaz was a near relative who had the right to redeem the property by paying the price, which he did.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In another Old Testament context, God is seen as the one who redeemed Israel from bondage in Egypt (&lt;b&gt;Exod. 6:6&lt;/b&gt;). As you know, the Jews had to put the blood of the Passover lamb on the lintel and doorposts of their homes. God then said, &lt;b&gt;and when I see the blood, I will pass over you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both the Exodus out of Egypt and the Boaz redemption of the property of Naomi and Ruth were OT pictures of our redemption through the blood of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Why blood, one might ask?&lt;b&gt; Hebrews 9:22&lt;/b&gt; states plainly, &lt;b&gt;without the shedding of blood there is no remission &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;or forgiveness of sin&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This of course takes us back to &lt;b&gt;Leviticus 17:11&lt;/b&gt;, where God explains, &lt;b&gt;For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All of those&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;animal sacrifices pointed ahead to Jesus, the Lamb of God, who by His death redeemed all who come to the Father through Him. Thus, God can be &lt;b&gt;just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus (Rom. 3:26).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Satan is the master of sowing confusion about Gods forgiveness under the guise of religion. Every single non-Christian world religion, every cult and every alleged Christian church that teaches that we must do somethingfasting, prayer, penance, self- denial, good worksto help pay for our sins and to earn Gods favor is accursed.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gal 1.6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 1.7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 1.8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 1.9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
My friend, if you try to seek Gods forgiveness in any way other than through the &lt;b&gt;redemption that is in Christ Jesus, &lt;/b&gt;you will remain unconverted and your eternal soul is in grave danger. If your hope of heaven rests on anything that you must do to earn it, than you today are as lost and lost can be no matter how many good works you perform.

Likewise, if you are claiming to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, but there is no evidence of the fruit of a new birth in your life, you may very well be one of those people to whom The Master will say, &lt;b&gt;I never knew you; depart from Me&lt;/b&gt;.

According to Scripture, each and every person was born into this world helplessly, hopelessly enslaved to sin and under Gods just condemnation. But with the shedding of His own blood, Jesus Christ, by the gracious plan of God, &lt;b&gt;tasted death for every man&lt;/b&gt;. Implicit in the biblical doctrine of redemption by grace through faith is that &lt;i&gt;God does something for us that we could not do for ourselves&lt;/i&gt;. We were enslaved to sin and like the debtor in &lt;b&gt;Matthew 18&lt;/b&gt;; we have no power or means to free ourselves.

The gospel of the grace of God reveals that God does not require or need our help in paying the price. In fact, it is an insult to Christ if we think that we can add anything of our own to the great price that He paid. Remember that Jesus said on the cross, &lt;b&gt;it is finished &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;John 19.30&lt;/b&gt;).

Would you please note that in verse 7 Paul does not say, &lt;i&gt;In Him, someday we hope to be redeemed&lt;/i&gt;. Nor does he say, &lt;i&gt;Were working at obtaining redemption, but we dont know yet if well get it until we see whether our good works tip the scale&lt;/i&gt;. Rather, he says, &lt;b&gt;In Him, we have redemption&lt;/b&gt;. In other words, biblical redemption is our current possession and experience. True, we await the future redemption of our bodies (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:23&lt;/b&gt;). True, the finalization of our redemption will not occur until Jesus returns (&lt;b&gt;Luke 21:28&lt;/b&gt;). But those glorious promises only apply to those who are in Christ today.

There is no redemption anywhere outside of Jesus Christ. There is no redemption in either Protestantism or Catholicism. There is no redemption in Calvinism or Arminianism.

There is only redemption by grace, through faith in Christ Jesus because redemption means that Christ and Christ alone had paid the price to free us from the penalty and power of sin.

What is salvation? Not a creed. You say, "Well, I believe the plan of salvation." You can believe the plan of salvation and go straight to hell. You're not saved by the plan of salvation, you're saved by the man of salvation.

Salvation is not a creed. It's not a code. You say, "Well, I believe if you live right you'll go to heaven." If you could be saved by living right, then Calvary was a blunder. It's not a cause. You say, "I'm a member of a good, fundamental, Bible believing church." It's not any of these things. It's Christ.

Salvation is not believing something, it is receiving Someone. The true gospel is one that centers in Jesus Christ.

So as we come to the Lords table, we can say in a sense that today is a day of reckoning for each person here in this room. Make your calling and election sure.

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;The ministry of the Holy Spirit is a very confusing topic for many people; but scripture has clearly shown us His person-hood, power, and promise. Join Pastor Ray for an encouraging word from Ephesians as we learn about the "promise of the Spirit" in the life of a believer.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.13 In whom ye also &lt;i&gt;trusted&lt;/i&gt;, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in Whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Which is the earnest (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;pledge, down payment, foretaste&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In verses 4-6, we looked at the work of God The Father in eternity past in planning the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In verses 7-12, we looked at the redeeming of the church by the shedding of the blood of The Lord Jesus Christ on the cross in human history past.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Today we will look at the significance of the work of the Holy Spirit in &lt;i&gt;sealing&lt;/i&gt; the believer and placing them into the body of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The Scriptures speak of the &lt;i&gt;promise of &lt;/i&gt;The Holy Spirit.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joel 2:28,29 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quoted by Peter on the Day of Pentecost&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Christ echoed this promise of The Spirit to His disciples
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luke 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Holy Spirit endues us with power from above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 1:4,5 And being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus spoke of The Person and work of The Holy Spirit in the gospel of John.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 7:37-39 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;please note that the process or order is that you come to Jesus first and then you drink of The Spirit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;). He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/86985754"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14:16,17 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Holy Spirit is another (one of the same kind, i.e. equal with Jesus) Comforter, Who will dwell in us forever).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In Whom (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in Whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This verse is one of the best explanations of &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; a person is saved, and &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; they are baptized and sealed into the body of Christ that I know of in the Word of God.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So, when is it that we are saved, baptized and sealed into the body of Christ? &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;After&lt;/i&gt; we hear the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;After&lt;/i&gt; we believe in Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt; Paul asked in his epistle to the Romans, &lt;b&gt;How can they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Romans 10.14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;According to &lt;b&gt;Romans 10:17, faith (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that is saving faith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Peter says that we are born again (saved) this way:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever (1 Pet. 1:23). &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is important beloved. Our salvation rests upon the very word of Almighty God. The gospel of Jesus Christ is an actual declaration from The Judge of the universe that the debt of our sin has been paid in full by His Son, and when we by grace alone through faith alone trust in Him, we are saved.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The gospel of &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; salvation. &lt;/b&gt;This gospel is personal. &lt;b&gt;2 Timothy 1.12 I know Whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This pattern is exactly what we see happening all throughout the book of Acts whether it be one on one evangelism, or sharing the gospel with a household or a multitude like on the Day of Pentecost.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Word of God is proclaimed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Spirit of God (like a sword on the Day of Pentecost) then convicts (pricks) us of sin, righteousness and judgment. (&lt;b&gt;John 16.8-11)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After we hear in our hearts the truth about our lost condition and we now see with our hearts the need to repent and trust in Christ alone for salvation we then call upon His Name and come to Him as Lord. &lt;b&gt;For whosoever shall call upon The Name of The Lord shall be saved. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;after &lt;/i&gt;we believe and trust in Christ that we are saved, baptized into the body of Christ and sealed forever with the Holy Spirit of promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The truth of the gospel of salvation&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
This is what we have learned thus far in Ephesians 1:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has chosen us.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has predestined us for adoption into His family.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has accepted us in The Beloved.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has redeemed us with the blood of His Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has forgiven our sins.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His grace has abounded toward us.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has made known to us the mystery of His will.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has given us an inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is all a part of this glorious gospel of salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What is &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;the biblical significance of the sealing and earnest of The Holy Spirit? &lt;/span&gt;

The sealing of The Holy Spirit&lt;b&gt; is the earnest (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;pledge, down payment, foretaste&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory.&lt;/b&gt;

The significance of the sealing of The Holy Spirit can be understood by how the term was used in the culture of that day.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesus was one of the world trade centers of that day. The goods from the East would come into Ephesus to be carried from there by sea to Rome and the other capitals of Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These merchants would buy their goods there, and then ship them from Ephesus to the Western world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When they would purchase the goods, they would pack them for shipment. Then they would then put their seal of ownership on the merchandise that was to be sent to the Roman port of Puteoli where the merchandise would be identified and claimed by the servants of the merchant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The seal was the sign of ownership.&lt;/span&gt; The seal meant that these goods belonged to the owner whose seal is affixed to them. Thus, the significance of seal of The Holy Spirit beloved is that it is God's mark of ownership on you.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Cor 1.22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 8.16 The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Though the mark of this seal is unseen by the naked eye, the manifestation of it is unmistakable. Because God has done something very real on the inside, something very real is going to be manifested on the outside. Something very real occurs. Your life is now God centered, Christ exalting and Spirit filled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your convictions and purpose in life is clear-cut. Your life is like a light shining in a dark place. People know who you are and Who live for.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Holy Spirit is a gift from The Father, as well as from Jesus. He is The Spirit of truth Who testifies of Jesus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Holy Spirit guides us into all truth. He brings glory to Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gal 5.22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Spirit of God will manifest His fruit in our lives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The earnest of The Spirit &lt;/b&gt;is the promise that there is more to come! The &lt;b&gt;earnest &lt;/b&gt;or sealing of the Holy Spirit is also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a &lt;i&gt;foretaste of heaven&lt;/i&gt;. It is the promise that &lt;i&gt;the best is yet to come&lt;/i&gt;. Its as if God dropped a million dollars into our spiritual bank account and says, &lt;i&gt;Though you cant spend it all now...you can enjoy &lt;b&gt;the interest&lt;/b&gt;! &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some commentators have suggested that the Greek word for &lt;b&gt;earnest&lt;/b&gt; can also be used to indicate an engagement ring. There is the idea of personal intimacy between the bridegroom and the bride. As Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride, so the Holy Spirit is His engagement ring that is given to us in anticipation of the wedding supper of The Lamb. (&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:7, 8&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is spoken of the bride in the Song of Solomon that &lt;b&gt;4.12 A garden enclosed &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; my sister, &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The purchased possession. &lt;/b&gt;This indwelling The Spirit affirms that we are a part of &lt;b&gt;the purchased possession. &lt;/b&gt;God declares His intention of completing our redemption by giving the Holy Spirit to us. &lt;i&gt;Our full redemption will not be complete until we are freed from our bodies.&lt;/i&gt;

Paul wrote to the Romans how that the whole creation was groaning and travailing together as they waited for the manifestation of the Sons of God, to wit, the redemption of our bodies. (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:23b; Phil. 3:20-21&lt;/b&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Eph&amp;amp;c=4&amp;amp;v=30#s=1101030"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 4:30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we are told, &lt;b&gt;And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This promise of complete redemption is also understood in light of the commercial practices of the day. When the merchandise was bought in Ephesus and sealed by the owner, it was then placed on the ship and carried to Rome. &lt;i&gt;When it arrived in port and identified by the seal, it was then claimed by the owner, who redeemed that which was His.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We have been sealed by God's mark of ownership, and are presently on the journey to the homeport. When (&lt;i&gt;not if&lt;/i&gt;) we arrive in glory, He will claim us as His for He purchased us; it is then that our redemption will be complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four truths regarding the sealing of The Spirit in the life of the believer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sign of security.&lt;/b&gt; The seal used by princes and kings and nobles in the time of the Bible was &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;a sign of security&lt;/span&gt;. We read in &lt;b&gt;Daniel 6:17, And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In other words, when you walked up to that stone and you saw the king's seal in the wax or whatever he used on that stone, nobody opened that den. Why? Because the king, the highest authority in the land, had sealed it. It was secure; it was not to be opened. The signet and the seal was the mark of the king.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Only someone higher than the king could break that seal. &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;That was the sign of security. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In&lt;b&gt; Matthew 27:66, &lt;/b&gt;we read about&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the sealing of Jesus &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; His tomb. When they buried Jesus Christ in the tomb, they rolled the stone across and what did they do? They sealed it with a seal of Rome, which was to say - No power can dare to open the seal unless it is a power greater than Rome. You know what happened? A power greater than Rome broke the seal. But it was the sign of security.

Thus, &lt;i&gt;the meaning of the Seal is that you are eternally secure in Christ. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I do not believe that a born again, sealed and Spirit filled believer can ever lose his or her salvation, because the seal of The Spirit of God upon our souls is an indelible mark that reads...&lt;i&gt;child of God&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;When you seal a package, the Seal&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;guarantees that &lt;i&gt;the product inside is genuine&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In light of the inability of an inferior power to break through the seal, it is my personal conviction that because of the sealing of The Holy Spirit, it is impossible for a born again, Spirit filled Christian to be demon possessed. Harassed b h the enemy? Yes. Oppressed by the enemy? Yes. Attacked by the enemy? Yes. Possessed? No. What part hath Christ with Belial?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sign of authenticity&lt;/b&gt;. In &lt;b&gt;I Kings 21&lt;/b&gt;, there is the story of King Ahab coveting the vineyard of a man by the name of Naboth. Long story short, Naboth refused to surrender his family plot of land, so Ahab sulks in front of his wife Jezebel who takes matters into her hands. So Jezebel sets out to get this vineyard. How does she do it? She wrote an official letter; &lt;i&gt;This vineyard now belongs to the king&lt;/i&gt;. And once she signed that letter and stamped it with the king's seal, the letter was a mark of authenticity. This was a legitimate letter from the king. The seal was the royal signature that authenticated the letter. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The seal of The Spirit indicates that our redemption is authentic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Sign of a finished transaction. &lt;/b&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Jeremiah 32, &lt;/b&gt;we read the account of God telling Jeremiah to go out and but a parcel of land. And there in verses 10-14, when he completed the purchase, the Bible says that he sealed the transaction. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The seal of The Spirit is a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;sign of a finished transaction.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Sign of protection from the wrath of God. &lt;/b&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Ezekiel 9.4-6 &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Revelation 7, &lt;/b&gt;we see the mark or seal of God upon the foreheads of His servants protected them from the coming wrath. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Thus, the seal of The Spirit is a sign that we have been delivered from the wrath of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So the sealing of The Holy Spirit is a sign of security, it is a sign of authenticity, it is a sign of a finished transaction and it is a sign that we have been delivered from the wrath to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This sealing is a source of great security and confidence in a world where anything and everything else is subject to change. The stability and power in the life and ministry of the apostle Paul came from one great discovery: that God's desire for His people is that we feel secure in His love and in His power, even if everything else in the world is uncertain.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you are looking for your ultimate security in health, then you do not understand the gospel correctly. If you looking for your ultimate security in your family or job or money or education, then you do not understand the gospel correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is only the power and reality of the gospel message that can provide ultimate security. It is only the gospel of Jesus Christ that drives us relentlessly and lovingly back to the One and only eternal and unshakable foundation for securityThe Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All of the redemption truths that we have looked into in verses 3-14 is to&lt;b&gt; the praise of His glory. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is now the third doxology in this chapter. As we have seen, Paul gives a doxology after he considers the work of each member of the Trinity. Here it is to the praise of the glory of God that the Holy Spirit regenerates us, becomes our refuge and seal, and gives us reality.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;While the Word of God is the ground of our faith, and faith is the receptive act by which we embrace our salvation, back of all that, there is a personal, divine Agent; The Holy Spirit of promise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every blessing for us in Christ, planned by the Father and sealed by the Spirit, is meant to make much of our triune God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The grace of God not only humbles you, it also glorifies the Author and Finisher of that grace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing words&lt;/h3&gt;
Let me close with this word to anyone who has not placed all of their faith and trust in The Lord Jesus Christ for the salvation of their eternal soul. Thus, they lack the witness and assurance of The Holy Spirit in their lives.

&lt;i&gt;The gospel must not only be proclaimed, it must not only be heard, it must be believed, if we are to be saved. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some people hear the gospel proclaimed and their response is Well, that's all very nice, but it's not for me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Well, that's true for you, but there's also something that's different that's true for me, because all roads lead up the mountain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Other people are indifferent to the gospel. Some people are actually angered by the gospel, offended by the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But nobody is neutral to the gospel!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There's only one &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;saving&lt;/span&gt; response to the gospel, and that is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as He is offered in the gospel as the only way of salvation, as the One Who purchases for us the forgiveness of sins, Who cleanses us, Who gives us the blessings of being adopted into God's family and eternal life forevermore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this study, Pastor Ray Viola unpacks a powerful and practical prayer written by the Apostle Paul to the Ephesian church. This is a prayer we can pray for ourselves or for others as we come before the Lord. Paul's heart was that this church would grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that would lead to their fruitfulness, other's blessings, and God's glory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;Like the previous section of Ephesians, this passage is a single sentence in the Greek language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/87465426"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.15 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because of their faith and love, Paul thanks God for the Ephesians, and now begins to pray for them. Paul heard two things about the Ephesians that inspired this prayer: their &lt;b&gt;faith in The Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Salvation begins with faith. The faith that believes and receives Jesus Christ as Lord. &lt;b&gt;Romans 10.9,10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Faith in The Lord Jesus will always be manifested by a love for the saints. Their love was indiscriminate. To love someone in The Lord is to love them as Jesus loves them, genuinely and sacrificially.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus told the disciples in &lt;b&gt;John 13.34,35 &lt;/b&gt;that the sign to the world that they were His disciples would be their love for one another.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A believers faith in Christ is proven by his love toward fellow saints. &lt;b&gt;First John 2.9-11&lt;/b&gt; says that if you claim to have saving faith yet hate your brother, you are a liar, a spiritual fraud. You cant love Christ and put your faith in Him without loving the people that He loves.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But this faith in Jesus and love for Him doesnt grow in a vacuum. We know that this love for Jesus is one that must be cultivated daily, because when Jesus wrote to the church of Ephesus approximately 30 years later, His chief complaint was that they had left their first love.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can learn all of the creeds of the church and all of the systematic theology possible, but if you do not love Jesus Christ and others, you are a tinkling cymbal or gonga spiritual zero. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;True salvation goes from the head and heart of the believer to other believers and to an unbelieving world in Christs Name. &lt;b&gt;Faith worketh by love (Gal 5.6).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The word &lt;b&gt;wherefore &lt;/b&gt;there in verse 15 is a connecting word. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would you take note that this particular prayer isnt a prayer of distress? It isnt a crisis prayer. Its a prayer of thanksgiving coupled with a plea to The Father to bestow deeper revelation knowledge of the Name of Jesus, the power of Jesus, the position of Jesus and the authority of Jesus. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul begins in verse 3 by blessing God for what He had done for them, and now in verse 15 he prays that He would do more for them.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;deep and intimate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) knowledge of Him:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Father of glory &lt;/b&gt;is a Hebraism which means that God is infinitely glorious in Himself and all glory is due to Him from His creatures. This phrase is not a denial of Christs deity, but is an affirmation of His incarnate humanity as Son of Man. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The first step in the Christian life is coming to the saving knowledge of The Lord Jesus Christ. At regeneration, the Holy Spirit opens our eyes so that we can see Who God is and who we are for the very first time. The Ephesians already had that salvation encounter with Jesus Christ. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The second step is to know Him better; that is what Paul is talking about here. Commentators agree that the spirit is God the Holy Spirit, The One present in all believers at the moment of salvation to seal them as The Lords possession and assure them of salvation.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matthew Henry wrote: &lt;i&gt;We have the revelation of the Spirit in the word: but will that avail us if we have not the wisdom of the Spirit in the heart?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And the knowing here is not the same kind of intellectual knowing that the devil has. It is a knowledge that is personal and intimate.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The difference between head, informational knowing about Jesus with actual, experiential knowledge of Jesus is like the difference between knowing that this brown stuff in the jar is honey because of the label on the jar, and knowing this is honey because of tasting it.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh taste and see that The Lord is good! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremiah 9.23,24 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: &lt;i&gt;But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me&lt;/i&gt;, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The word &lt;b&gt;knew &lt;/b&gt;(yada) means &lt;i&gt;far more than &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;intellectual knowledge&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 17.3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nearly 30 years after coming to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, we hear Paul declaring, &lt;b&gt;that I might know Him (Phil 3.18). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The earthly goal of the Christian life is not sinless perfection but spiritual maturity and growth in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ (&lt;b&gt;2 Peter 3.18&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.18 The eyes of your understanding (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The eyes of your understanding being enlightened- &lt;/b&gt;When Paul prays for the eyes of their understanding to be enlightened, he is saying, &lt;b&gt;understanding &lt;/b&gt;the scriptures about God is only part of &lt;b&gt;knowing &lt;/b&gt;God!&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The prayer for eyes to be supernaturally opened here is similar to when Elisha prayed for his servants eyes to be opened to the spirit realm.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This was idea behind for the Paul Baloche song, Open the eyes of my heart Lord. Beloved, we never outgrow our need for the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;That you might know the hope of His calling- &lt;/b&gt;God wants us to know the hope of His calling. Pastor Chuck Smith wrote,&lt;i&gt;When I realize what God has waiting for me, it gives me the strength, the energy, the courage, all that I need to go on.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the NT, we read about the &lt;b&gt;hope of righteousness (Gal 5.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;5), the hope of glory (Col 1.27), the hope of eternal life (Titus 1.2); &lt;/b&gt;in &lt;b&gt;1 Timothy 1.1, &lt;/b&gt;The Lord Jesus Christ Himself is called &lt;b&gt;our hope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Scripture, hope is not a reference to uncertainty or a lack of confidence in what the future will bring; rather, hope is another word for confident expectation that is both objective and subjective.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Objectively, we have a hope that exists outside ourselves-Jesus Christ will return to reign visibly over all.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Subjectively, hope is the inward confidence we have that we will participate in that kingdom.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;His inheritance in the saints.&lt;/b&gt; This indicates how precious we are to God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.19 And what is the exceeding (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;incomparable; immeasurable; surpassing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) greatness of His power to us- ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power, &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.20 Which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;His power &lt;/b&gt;is &lt;b&gt;toward us who believe- &lt;/b&gt;Oh how I (we) need a revelation of the divine resources that are available to us as a child of God in Christ Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The power of God available to us now is like the mighty power &lt;i&gt;that He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The power of God available to us now is like the mighty power that God worked (verse 20) when He&lt;i&gt;seated Christ at His right hand in the heavenly places&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus' "right-hand" position in heaven is a place of authority and the fact that He is "seated" signifies that His the work atonement is completed!&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Father gives unto us this resurrection and ascension power in order that we might live and die for the glory of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.21 Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Above all principality, power, might, dominion and every name- &lt;/b&gt;In&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippians 2.9-11&lt;/b&gt;, we understand that &lt;b&gt;God has also highly exalted Him, given Him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/b&gt; The Father has seated Jesus there in the heavenly places, far above, a name above every name that is named.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul said in &lt;b&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/b&gt; that at the cross God &lt;b&gt;disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in Christ.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This means that when Jesus rose from the dead, He was exalted over all the hosts of hell. They are a defeated foe. They are not yet out of the world. And battles are yet to be fought. But the power from God for us now in these battles is a resurrection power nowto live and die for the glory of Christ.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I really do not want to belabor this point because we are going to be covering it more in depth when we get to chapter 6, and look into the theme of spiritual warfare, Lord willing. But it is an important practical point for all of us to consider. Sin is defeated at the cross; yet sin remains to be fought. Satan was defeated at the cross; yet Satan remains to be fought. And for this fight, Pauls prayer is that God would grant unto us the resurrection power of Jesus Christto live and die for the glory of Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.22 And hath put all things under His feet (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;quote from &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 8.6), and gave Him to be the head over all things to the church, &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1.23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the fullness of Him Who fills everything in every way&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Head of the body- &lt;/b&gt;Jesus Christ is The One and only Head of the body of Christ both on earth and in heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every month at our church board meeting we begin the meeting with an acknowledgement that Jesus is the head of the body, the church. We are not there to conduct the business as we see fit, we are there to get the mind of the Lord, that He might direct the activities of the church. We are not there to govern the church, we are there to listen to Him, to find out what He wants done. And we seek His council and we seek His advice, for He is the head of all things to the church.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christ has so identified Himself with His church that we are said to be His very body. This is as when Adam described Eve as &lt;b&gt;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh &lt;/b&gt;in &lt;b&gt;Genesis 2.23. &lt;/b&gt;We will see this more in chapter 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Power of Prayer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Many people find it hard to pray regularly, which is unfortunate because prayer is among the most powerful tools for advancing the kingdom of God. If that is you, consider setting aside a period of time each day to spend in prayer.even if it be 5 minutes to start and then build upon. Consider being a part of one of the many prayer groups here.

No created being escapes death. It strikes the most famous, the richest, and the powerful. Those who refuse to trust in Christ alone for salvation will suffer the eternal wrath of God for their sins. The gospel is that Jesus Christ rose from the dead after He died on the cross for our sins. He ascended to the right hand of The Father of glory, where He rules and reigns over all principalities and powers.

Will you drop your sword of rebellion against His rule as Lord in your life today? Will you repent of your sin and embrace Jesus Christ as Lord today? Today IS the day of salvation.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>John 3:16 - The Lord&amp;#039;s Supper</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;John 3:16 For God so loved the world (so did God love the world), that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth (no exclusion but unbelief) in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&lt;/span&gt;

Years ago, an old saint wrote these thoughts about John 3.16 that have been modified by many other people.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/88017692"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-202" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"For God" The greatest Being&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"So loved" Using the greatest emotion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"The world" The greatest number&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"That He gave" The greatest act&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"His only begotten Son" The greatest Gift&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"That whosoever" The greatest invitation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"Believeth" The greatest simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"In Him" The greatest Person&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"Should not perish" The greatest deliverance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"But" The greatest difference&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"Have" The greatest certainty&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"Everlasting Life" The greatest possession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Why did God send His Son into the world? He sent Him on a mission to redeem and rescue sinners. We are all born sinners by nature and sinners by choice.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Every sin starts within because our whole lives are oriented in the direction of ourselves." -Alistair Begg

We are born spiritually self righteouslet Tim Keller explain this to us just how deep and wide this sin problem is:

"What is the biblical view of sin? Sin is a distortion and dislocation of the heart from its true center in God (Romans 1:2125). This distortion is expressed as a basic motive for all human lifethe heart desire of every person to be his or her own savior and lord. People who flout Gods moral law are doing this overtly, of course, but even moral, religious people are trying to be their own saviors by earning salvation and being good. It is just as possible to avoid Jesus as Savior (to be your own savior) by keeping Gods law as by breaking it. Everyone is separated from God equallyregardless of the external form of behavior. People are ultimately lost only if they are too proud to see they are lost and in need of a Savior who saves by sheer grace, just as a drowning person offered a life preserver will only die if he wont admit he needs it."

The wages of sin is death. All of the ills and pain and sorrow and suffering in our lives is due to sin and the consequences of sin. There is only one cure for the malady of sin that has infected and corrupted every person, and that is the saving love of God in Christ Jesus.

So using John 3.16 as my launch pad today, Id like for us as born again followers of Jesus Christ to ponder 11 things about the love of God in Christ to prepare our hearts to take The Lords Supper.I would also pray in Jesus name that any who have yet to repent of their sin and confess Christ as Lord today would hear in these 11 redemptive facts, the genuine loving appeal of God to you this morning to trust in Christ as your Savior.

Those 11 things about the love of God in Christ is that it is infinite, undeserved, gracious, sacrificial, delivering, death defying, unending, reconciling, regenerating, costly and God glorifying.

&lt;strong&gt;(1) This saving love of God in Christ on the cross is an infinite love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts 2.23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts 3.18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 1.20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Calvary was the predetermined plan of God for the redemption of sinful, broken sinners like me. The cross of Jesus Christ is the supreme manifestation of Gods love for us. This infinite love of God that existed before time began was manifested in time on mount Calvary.

&lt;strong&gt;(2) This saving love of God in Christ describes an undeserved love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Romans 5.8 But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. 11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Romans 4.5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 3.18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Romans 5.6,8,10 tell us that Jesus died for the ungodly, for sinners for His enemies. God has chosen to love an evil, sinful world that is in rebellion against Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The greatness of Gods love is measured in terms of its unsearchable and unimaginable reach. The world spoken of in verse 16 is the rebellious world of Gods image- bearers. God loved rebels, fools, and idolaters so much that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to redeem them. There is no greater love.

&lt;strong&gt;(3) This saving love of God in Christ is a gracious love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesians 2.4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The saving love of God in Christ is a boast defying, good works renouncing message. Because the saving love of God is gracious, it eliminates any and all merit on behalf of fallen man. A gospel that is man centered or ritual centered or works centered has no power to save.

&lt;strong&gt;(4) This saving love of God in Christ is a sacrificial love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isa 53:4-10 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him; He hath put Him to grief: when thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
God gave His only begotten Son. The cross of Calvary is a sacrificial love; God gave His Son, His only Son. Jesus Christ, laid down His life for us. This sacrificial love was foreshadowed in the Old Testament accounts of Abraham offering up of Isaac, The Passover Lamb of the Exodus, and the brazen serpent on the pole in Numbers 21.

&lt;strong&gt;(5) This saving love of God in Christ is a delivering love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Colossians 1.13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts 26.18 we have been delivered from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 2.9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is through faith in Jesus Christ that sinners are delivered from the authority of Satan, and the powers of darkness.

&lt;strong&gt;(6) This saving love of God in Christ is a death defying love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hebrews 2.14,15 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Please note that one of the reasons why Jesus died for our sins, was in order that He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and in doing so, deliver all who trust in Him from the fear of death.

The fear of death here is not merely a fear of dyingthat is perfectly natural. It is rather the fear that has to do with punishment, a fear which perfect love casts out (1 John 4:18). Gods love in Christ assures us that there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Rom. 8:1).

&lt;strong&gt;(7) This saving love of God in Christ is an unending love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jer 31.3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ro 8:38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Only those in Christ will experience the unending love of God. We are given the life and the love of God here and now, and when we die, we will experience the unending love of God in a greater measure.
Gods love for His sheep shall never end, and the love of God will never be withdrawn from those who place their trust Him.
We love Him because He first loved us. The gospel of Jesus Christ is an infinite, holy love.

&lt;strong&gt;(8) This saving love of God in Christ is a reconciling love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Cor 5.19-21 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us:we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
At the core of the good news of the gospel is what has oftenbeen called the great exchange or imputation. Our sin isImputed (reckoned, accounted) to Christ as he is made to be sinfor us; His righteousness is imputed to us as we receive hisrighteous status (v. 21). He takes our sin; he gives us hisrighteousness. An individual is reconciled to God (vv. 18, 20)and made a new creation in Christ (v. 17) on the basis of this
exchange.

Things drastically change in light of the exchange of Christsrighteousness for our sin. Our legal standing before God hasshifted from that of unrighteousness to righteousness. The statusof our relationship with God has moved from conflict toreconciliation, from enmity to peace and with God.

&lt;strong&gt;(9) This saving love of God in Christ is a regenerating love&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Titus 3.4-7 But after that the kindness and love of God our&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Savior toward man appeared, Not by works of righteousness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Our very being is regenerated and changed by transferred from theimpending death of this world to the promised life of Gods newcreational order, leading us to an increased appetite for that whichpleases God and a growing distaste for that which does not please Him.

&lt;strong&gt; (10) This saving love of God in Christ is a costly love&lt;/strong&gt;

Free does not mean that there was no cost involved.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 6.20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts 20.28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with His own blood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 1.18,19 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The price for our salvation was a costly one. John 19.30-Jesus paid the entirety of our sin debt. not free for God or for Christ, but it is freely offered to us through faith in His Son Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;(11) This saving love of God in Christ is a God glorifying love.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Cor 1.30,31 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Beloved, Jesus Christ IS the gospel!! The grace that saves us from the debt and power of sin is the death defeating, bondage breaking, wrath absorbing, heart transforming gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing that we can do to earn it, or merit it, or deserve it. God has not demanded that we meet a standard that we could never achieve in order to receive eternal life. Salvation is a free gift that is received by grace alone, through faith alone, in The Lord Jesus Christ alone.

The atonement of Jesus Christ fully satisfied the wrath and righteousness of God, and it is that gift of God that is given to everyone and anyone who repents and believe in Jesus Christ and confess Him as Lord.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;What is the difference between the Jew and the Gentile? Do they both need salvation? Jesus has made them in Him one...join Pastor Ray Viola for a practical and powerful time in the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;This section begins the unfolding of the revelation of the mystery body, called the church that we will talk more about in Ephesians 3 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 2.11-13 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Here is how this portion of the letter is constructed:
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/89915057"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;2.1-3 Old condition&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Dead to God/unregenerate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is how every person is born into this world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;2.4-10 New condition&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Alive to God/born of The Spirit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is what is needed for one to receive forgiveness of sin and have the assurance of eternal life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;2.11-22 Reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles into one body&lt;/span&gt;

This mystery body is the one body that Jesus Himself prayed for inJohn 17.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 10.16 And other sheep (&lt;/b&gt;Gentiles&lt;b&gt;) I have, which are not of this fold (&lt;/b&gt;Israel&lt;b&gt;): them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As we see in &lt;b&gt;Revelation 5&lt;/b&gt;, the body of Christ is made up of all of those who have been &lt;b&gt;redeemed by the blood of The Lamb Jesus Christ out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 3.11 &lt;/b&gt;In Christ&lt;b&gt; there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond &lt;i&gt;nor&lt;/i&gt; free: but Christ &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; all, and in all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;Before we dig into our study, Id like us to note the different grammar or terms that The Holy Spirit uses to describe the distinction between the Gentiles and Gods covenant people of Israel in verses 11-22.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The Gentiles are called&lt;/span&gt;: uncircumcised (vs11); without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, without God in the world (vs.12). Afar off (vs13,17). Strangers and foreigners (vs19).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;The Jews are called&lt;/span&gt;: commonwealth (citizens) (vs12), them that were near (vs17), saints (vs19).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Jew and Gentile together in Christ are called&lt;/span&gt;: one (vs14), one new man (vs15), one body (vs16), household of God (vs19), holy temple in The Lord (vs21), habitation of God through The Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Since the Day of Pentecost, every single person on planet earth is either and unsaved Jew or unsaved Gentile or they are born again and a part of the body of Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God. 1 Cor. 10.32&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands.&lt;/b&gt;

The church in Ephesus was made up largely of Gentiles. There was just a small colony of Jews there. To be called uncircumcised was a Jewish term of derision that signified that a person was a Gentile and outside the covenant people of God.

Remember what David called Goliath? &lt;b&gt;This uncircumcised Philistine! (1 Samuel 17.26)&lt;/b&gt;

J. Vernon McGee writes: &lt;i&gt;God made a real distinction between Jew and Gentile, beginning with Abraham and advancing to the advent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost; &lt;/i&gt;(which was a fulfillment of &lt;b&gt;Joel 2.28,29&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;i&gt;. Israel occupied a unique position among the nations. A Gentile could come in only as a proselyte. In time, this valid distinction caused friction because Israel became proud of her position. Israelites came to look down on Gentiles, and hatred crept into the hearts of both groups.&lt;/i&gt;

Jesus tore down those walls of ethnic taboo every time He ministered to Gentiles, like the Samaritan woman in John 4. Or when He taught the parable of the Good Samaritan.

While it is true that one had to be circumcised to belong to the people of God (&lt;b&gt;Genesis 17.9-14&lt;/b&gt;), it is equally true that over time, the true meaning of circumcision had been abused and had become a mere ritual or formality with no real impact of a persons manner of living.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 2.29 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;But he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision &lt;i&gt;is that&lt;/i&gt; of the heart, in the spirit, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; not in the letter; whose praise &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; not of men, but of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 3.3 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In &lt;b&gt;Eph 2.11&lt;/b&gt;, The Holy Spirit reminds all Gentile believers that we contribute nothing to our standing before God. As we saw in verses 4-10, we are reminded that it is only by Gods grace and good pleasure that we are drawn near to God by the precious blood of Jesus Christ shed upon His cross (vs.13,16).

In &lt;b&gt;Romans 11.17-24&lt;/b&gt;, Paul reminds Gentile believers that they are by nature a wild olive tree who by Gods grace have been grafted into the good olive tree of the covenant that God made with Israel through faith in Christ. He reminds us Gentiles that we only stand by faith and thus there is no room for boasting or pride.

Notice in verse 12 how far away they were from God.

&lt;b&gt;2.12 That at that time ye were without (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;separated, apart from&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) Christ, being aliens (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;estranged, shut up from ones fellowship and intimacy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) from the commonwealth (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;citizenship, community&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of Israel, and strangers (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;foeigners&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gr. Atheos; atheists&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) in the world: &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Without Christ-&lt;/b&gt; This is the best definition of a lost man. It is the opposite of being in Christ. Though every human being is made in the image of God, and thus belongs to Him as a part of His creation, until they are regenerated through faith in Christ, they are estranged from Him and spiritually lost.

&lt;b&gt;Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel- &lt;/b&gt;Actually, it can read &lt;i&gt;alienated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;from the citizenship of Israel&lt;/i&gt;. That is the accurate definition of a Gentile. The Gentile had no God-given religion as had Israel. Though some Gentiles were admitted into Judaism as proselytes, Gentiles as a whole were excluded; thus alienated.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 4.18 alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Strangers from the covenants of promise (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)-&lt;/b&gt; They had no right to go back in the Old Testament and take the promises which God made to Israel and then appropriate them for themselves.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jere 31.31-34&lt;/b&gt; speaks of the New Covenant that God made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah that Gentiles are grafted into by grace through faith in Messiah Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;No hope- &lt;/b&gt;Unlike Israel, the Gentiles had no expectation of a personal Messiah-Deliverer and the Messianic Age.

&lt;b&gt;Without God in this world-&lt;/b&gt; Literally in the Greek, &lt;b&gt;without God, &lt;/b&gt;reads an atheist; because to believe in any god other than the True and Living God is not believing in God at all, but a god of my own making. Read &lt;b&gt;Psalm 115.4-8.&lt;/b&gt;The identity of The True and Living God is not up for negotiation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 8.5 There is one God, The Father of Whom are all things, as we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom are all things, and we by Him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This shows that they were not only spiritually dead, but they also did not have the access to God that the Jews enjoyed.This is a terrible, awful condition that Paul describes. To be without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenants of promise is the worst possible condition that any human being can be in&lt;i&gt;regardless &lt;/i&gt;of their outward religious affiliation or beliefs, their financial or social status.

I cannot think of a more frightening thing than for a person to be without Christ and without God in this world. Please note that a person who is without Christ, (&lt;i&gt;apart from Christ&lt;/i&gt;), is also a person who is without God (&lt;i&gt;an atheist&lt;/i&gt;) in this world.

Dont take my word for it. Listen to Paul the apostles personal testimony.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 3.4-6 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
How did Paul describe this condition after he was born again by grace through faith in Jesus Christ?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Timothy 1.12,13 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;impious, against God, a slanderer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), and a persecutor, and injurious (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;insulter, despiteful, an insolent man lifted up with pride&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;): but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Despite how zealous, devout and religious he was. Despite that fact that he had a zeal to learn the Torah and sat under one of the most prestigious rabbi teachers Gamaliel, now that Paul has been born of The Spirit, he describes himself before knowing Christ as a blasphemer, a persecutor and injurious.

&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Religious, but unregenerate. Devout but deceived. To say that I believe in God only makes me not a fool. To say that I believe in God puts on equal belief with demons. It is not until I am born of The Spirit, by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone that I cease being an atheist in the biblical sense of the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Verse 12 is an incredibly horrific description of man apart from Christ. But now in verse 13, notice what The Father has done through Christ to change that hopeless situation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.13 But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Many people suggest different ways to come &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; to God. Some think you can come to God by keeping the 10 commandments, or by being baptized as a baby or by observing holy days, or by belonging to a particular denomination.&lt;b&gt;Col 2.8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 2.16,17 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The cross of Jesus Christ plus anything negates the cross of Jesus entirely, and leaves you lost.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 2.10 And ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The gospel of Jesus Christ is not a mixture of Gods grace with human effort or merit. It is all of grace, n ot of works lest any man shuld boast.

The only way to be &lt;b&gt;brought near&lt;/b&gt; to God is &lt;b&gt;by the blood of Christ&lt;/b&gt;. What Jesus did on the cross, suffering as a guilty sinner in the place of guilty sinners, brings us &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; to God.

It is only through the blood of Jesus Christ that we are brought from position of being afar off to one of being near to The Father through faith in Christ Jesus our Lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 2.37-39&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;According to &lt;b&gt;Isaiah 59.1, 2 &lt;/b&gt;we are all afar off because our sins have separated us from God.&lt;b&gt;Behold, the Lord 's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will not hear.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
God The Father paid the highest price to secure a people for Himself, by sending His One and Only Begotten Son to live a perfect life and die a dishonorable death so that His wrath would be satisfied and His grace extended to sinners. That is what the word propitiation means:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4.10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whom (&lt;/b&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;b&gt;) God sent forth to be a propitiation (&lt;/b&gt;Gr. &lt;i&gt;Mercy seat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. To declare at this time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;declared right in the sight of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) by faith apart from the deeds of the law. Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not the God also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith. Romans 3.25-30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Every person who trusts in Christ alone for salvation, Jew or Gentile, is brought into spiritual union and intimacy with God. This is the reconciliation of &lt;b&gt;Romans 5.10; 2 Cor. 5:1821 &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Colossians 1.20-22.&lt;/b&gt; The atoning work accomplished by Christs death on the cross washes away the penalty of sin. Reconciliation is not a &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt;, but an &lt;b&gt;act of God &lt;/b&gt;by which we are once and for all delivered from &lt;i&gt;estrangement &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fellowship with God&lt;/i&gt;.

Those who were &lt;b&gt;separated from the covenant &lt;/b&gt;have been &lt;b&gt;united &lt;/b&gt;to God; Those who were &lt;b&gt;alienated &lt;/b&gt;have been &lt;b&gt;reconciled &lt;/b&gt;through faith in Christ; &amp;amp; those who were &lt;b&gt;far off &lt;/b&gt;have been &lt;b&gt;brought near &lt;/b&gt;by His precious shed blood on the cross.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1.14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 9.12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There is not one plan of salvation for the Jews and another for the Gentiles. Listen to the conclusion of the council that was held in &lt;b&gt;Acts 15 &lt;/b&gt;regarding whether Gentiles needed to be circumcised in addition to placing faith in Jesus to be saved.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 15.11 But we (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) believe that through the grace of The Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the Gentiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1.12 But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Received in Gr. &lt;i&gt;To take hold upon, lay hold on to, choose&lt;/i&gt;).

Through Christs shed blood on the cross (&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2:13,16&lt;/strong&gt;), sinners are reconciled to God (&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5:19-21&lt;/strong&gt;). But reconciliation accomplished is not personal reconciliation until you reach out with the hand of faith and place all of your trust in Jesus Christ as Lord. Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. (&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 22:17&lt;/strong&gt;)

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;As we continue through the Ephesian series, Pastor Ray Viola teaches through an important lesson for the church. In Christ, He has torn down the division between Jews and Gentiles; He has, through His blood broken down the ethnic and racial lines that this broken world draws and dictates. Jesus Christ is the Prince of peace and the Chief Cornerstone!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

Verses 14-16 are one sentence in the NT Greek.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.14 For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Peace&lt;/b&gt; is mentioned four times in three verses (vv. 1415, 17 [twice]).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14.27&lt;/b&gt;categorically indicates that Jesus alone is the believers source of peace. One of the glorious titles of Messiah Jesus is that He would be called, &lt;b&gt;The&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Prince of Peace (Isa 9.6).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is Jesus Christ Who is the author, center, and substance of sinners being at peace with God and one another.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom 5.1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wall of partition- &lt;/b&gt;There was an inscription on the wall of the outer courtyard of the Jerusalem temple warning Gentiles that they would only have themselves to blame for their death if they passed beyond it into the inner courts. It was that wall in the temple that partitioned off the Court of the Gentiles from the areas accessible only to Jews.

Paul uses that wall of separation as symbolic of the social, religious, and spiritual separation that was a cause of hostility between Jews and Gentiles and kept them apart.But I would even take that thought one step further. Jesus has also torn down the walls of racial prejudice and separation. The color of your skin makes no difference to The Living God. White, brown, red, blackall are one in Christ. We have been made one new man in Christ.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I do not believe in the universal brotherhood of man and the universal Fatherhood of God. To me that is a damnable heresy. I believe a true brotherhood is composed of those who are in Christ. A man may have skin as white as the driven snow, but if he is not a child of God, he is not my brother. A man may have skin as black as midnight, and if he is a child of God, he is my brother. We are something new. We are in Christa new man. &lt;/i&gt;J. Vernon Magee

In Christ, there are no such thing as a white churches or black churches or city churches or urban churches, there is only one church, one body and One Shepherd.I would also say that in Christ there is no longer any room for economic distinctions or prejudice.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;James 2.1-5 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Having abolished- &lt;/b&gt;Gr. &lt;i&gt;Rendered inoperative.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Through His death on the cross, the OT ceremonial laws, feasts, and sacrifices, which uniquely separated Jews from Gentiles, &lt;i&gt;lost its power or effectiveness&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;In Himself one new man-&lt;/b&gt; The word new (&lt;i&gt;kainon&lt;/i&gt;) means new or fresh in character or quality rather than new in the sense of recent in time (&lt;i&gt;neos)&lt;/i&gt;. It refers to something completely unlike anything else. In the mystery body, the church, Gentiles do not become Jews, nor do Jews become Gentiles. Instead believing Jews and Gentiles become Christians, a whole new single entity.This is a different metaphor than the "new man" of &lt;b&gt;Eph 4:24&lt;/b&gt;; in that passage the "new man" refers to the new life a believer has through a relationship to Christ.

Because we have been made one in Christ, we have a responsibility to maintain that peace with one another.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 3.15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 4.1-3 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jesus Christ did not abolish the moral law of God&lt;/h3&gt;
I must&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;inject here a very important point that is grossly misunderstood and misinterpreted by many people.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The grace of God does not abolish Gods moral law.Please note who will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 5.3-7 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger (&lt;/b&gt;Gr. &lt;i&gt;Pornos; one who engages in unlawful sexual intercourse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), nor unclean person (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;impure, lewd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), nor covetous man (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;greedy of gain; wanting what belongs to someone else&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), who is an idolater (&lt;i&gt;worshipper fo self&lt;/i&gt;), hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As Jews and Gentiles are brought to God through Christ Jesus, they are brought together, or reconciled with each other as well.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/90539523"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;One body- John 17.21-23 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt; in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;17. And came and preached peace to you which were afar off (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Gentiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;), and (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;peace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;) to them that were nigh (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Jews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preached peace- &lt;/b&gt;This peace comes via&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;proclaiming the good news that sinners can be reconciled to God by the salvation which is through Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 10.36 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The word which &lt;i&gt;God&lt;/i&gt; sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access- &lt;/b&gt;Our access to God is only through faith in Christs sacrificial death. Please note that all 3 Persons of the trinity are mentioned here.
Through Christ, all believers have access to God the Father through the Holy Spirit because of Christs death on the cross.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 10.19,20 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul mentions four metaphors for the church: Fellow citizens (19), Gods household (19), Gods temple (20) and (4) habitation of God
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul employs a term that was common to political life in ancient cities like Ephesus. &lt;b&gt;Strangers &lt;/b&gt;(also &lt;a href="https://www.esvbible.org/Ephesians+2.12/"&gt;v. 12&lt;/a&gt;) were complete foreigners with no rights or privileges (see &lt;a href="https://www.esvbible.org/Acts+16.20-23/"&gt;Acts 16:2023&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;b&gt;Foreigners&lt;/b&gt; were non-citizens who dwelt in the city and were accorded customary privileges as neighbors. Only &lt;b&gt;citizens&lt;/b&gt; had full protections and rights in the city.In Christ, we are full fledged citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets- &lt;/b&gt;In other words the apostles and prophets were used by God to lay the foundation.The early church built its doctrine upon that of the apostles.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers (Acts 2:42).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;prophets&lt;/b&gt; are of the New Testament era, not the Old Testament. Prophets follows the word apostles here and in &lt;b&gt;3:5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4.11&lt;/b&gt;. These men received the revelation of the mystery of the church in the present Age, which had been hidden in days past, that is, in Old Testament times.Paul writes in &lt;b&gt;Eph 3.5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; revealed (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not then revealed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief Cornerstone- &lt;/b&gt;Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone reveals that Christ is the Rock on which the church is built. Paul makes this very clear:In ancient building practices the chief cornerstone was carefully placed. It was crucial because the entire building was lined up with it. The churchs foundation, that is, the apostles and prophets, needed to be correctly aligned with Christ. All other believers are built on that foundation, measuring their lives with Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 3:11).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Peter states it like this&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed (1 Pet. 2:68).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Another important thing to note here is that Peter says that the Lord Jesus is that chief cornerstone. Therefore Peter understood that &lt;i&gt;that interpretation is what &lt;/i&gt;The Lord meant when He said,&lt;b&gt; And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matt. 16:18). &lt;/b&gt;Jesus is talking about Himself. He is the Rock on which the church is built upon, not Peter.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 4.11,12 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Salvation is in the Chief Cornerstone. Jesus Christ alone, not Catholicism, Protestantism or any other ism.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 22. In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The temple in the Old Testament was the physical representation of the divine manifestation. The sacrifices, the rituals, the festivalsthese all took place at the temple because God dwelt there.

Worship and fellowship today is not limited to one location, because the church themselves have become the new temple of God. They are the habitation of God by The Spirit (see &lt;a href="https://www.esvbible.org/John+4.21/"&gt;John 4:21&lt;/a&gt;).

In Christ we are fitly framed and builded together as living epistles through &lt;b&gt;The Spirit&lt;/b&gt;. The words &lt;b&gt;groweth &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;builded &lt;/b&gt;suggest a &lt;i&gt;work in progress.&lt;/i&gt;The body of Christ &lt;i&gt;not an organization, it is a living organism. &lt;/i&gt;The Living God builds us up and fitly frames our lives together by His Spirit, not by programs.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 4.16 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fitly joined together&lt;/b&gt;- Jesus said, &lt;b&gt;I will build My church&lt;/b&gt;. Thus it is vital for us to recognize the sovereignty of God at work here in the local church.The participle translated is joined together is a Greek word that is used only here and in &lt;b&gt;4:16&lt;/b&gt;. It denotes that the various parts of the building are skillfully fitted to each other, not haphazardly thrown together.

In Christ as living stones, we are growing by The Spirit as a living temple. This growing is an ongoing process until The Lord Jesus calls us home. This is a very practical truth beloved.Because the building of the church is a work in progress, Inevitably, then, there will be friction between us. That friction with others in the body is a tool that God uses to develop my prayer life, longsuffering, grace, forgiveness and love.

In one sense beloved, the people who are in your life are answers to prayer and ordained by divine providence to knock the rough edges off of me. So let the hammering take place, dear brother. Dont try to short-circuit the process, precious sister. Youre being fit together as living stones for a holy habitation in which God can dwell forever.

In &lt;b&gt;1 Kings 6&lt;/b&gt;, we read that as the temple was being constructed, all of the cutting of the stones took place away from the temple mount. Consequently, when the rocks arrived on site, there was not the sound of a hammer or a chisel heard.

So, too, there is coming a time when there will not be the sound of a hammer or chisel in our lives. But that will not be until we go to be with The Lord. In heaven, all of the living stonesJew, Gentile, male, female, brother, sisterwill fit together perfectly, the chiseling and shaping having been done here in this quarry called earth.

In Christ we are built together for a habitation of God through The Spirit-&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 12.13 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether &lt;i&gt;we be&lt;/i&gt; Jews or Gentiles, whether &lt;i&gt;we be&lt;/i&gt; bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;God indwells believers, not buildings. The Scriptures clearly state that God has never dwelt in any building made with hands, and it is a pagan philosophy, which places God in a human- made structure.

God meets with His people in joyful communion wherever and whenever they are gathered together in Spirit and in truth.

Let's talk about walls for a moment beloved:Is there a wall of racial or economic prejudice in your heart today that you need to repent of?
Is your concept of what the church is supposed to look like driven by trends, comfort, race, economics, location or the truth of Scripture?

Since we are living stones, divinely fitly joined together by The Spirit of God, lets consider your involvement and investment in the body for a moment:While it is true that God has different gifts and callings within the body of Christ, it is equally true that when you come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, you stand before God on a par with any pastor, teacher, evangelist, bishop etc. I pray that every single person who calls KF their home church is not made to feel inferior to any other part or unnecessary is fulfilling Gods plan for us to reach the lose and make disciples.

If we are to accomplish all that Christ has ordained us to accomplish as a local church, every single person here is called upon to invest your gifts and talents for the glory of God.

This involvement and investment is a biblical one that is clearly taught in the many one anothers found in the NT.What degree of investment and involvement are you making in personal relationships with others in the body here? Do you feel that your relationships and investments in other peoples lives should your responsibility and Spirit driven or program driven?

Gods reconciliation is already complete. He is ready to receive you if you are ready to come. Therefore, the message that goes out is  &lt;b&gt;be ye reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:20).&lt;/b&gt;

Repent of your sin and believe on The Lord Jesus Christ. Deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow Me.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 86.5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;The greatest mystery ever revealed was not a man-made plot for treasures or trinkets of this earth, but the glorious and eternal plan of God to send His Son Jesus Christ to save both Jews and Gentiles, as Paul said, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Paul's gospel was the gospel of grace which he received and which he proclaimed. Have you received this grace? it only comes through repentance and receiving Christ as Savior and Lord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

Paul goes through a lot of theology in Ephesians 3, verses 112 to get to his conclusion in verse 13. His concern is that the Ephesians not be overly concerned for him. During his Roman imprisonment Paul was under house arrest. In the day he was free to move around the house with the supervision of soldiers, but every night he was chained to a soldier to make sure he did not escape before his trial before Caesar.

He may be incarcerated and suffering for the sake of the gospel, but the believers in Ephesus should not think that unusual nor lose heart. Paul has not lost heartbecause the glory of Christ and the need to proclaim the gospel was far weightier than his suffering.

The mystery of the gospel &lt;b&gt;(vv. 26), &lt;/b&gt;the ministry of the gospel &lt;b&gt;(vv. 79), &lt;/b&gt;and the manifold wisdom of the gospel&lt;b&gt; (vv. 1012) &lt;/b&gt;and above all, the personal sacrifice and suffering of the glorious Lord of the gospel for my sin debt makes any counting the cost an easy calculation.

This was the same concern and perspective that Paul shared with the Philippians.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 1.12,13 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The last thing Paul wanted was people to feel sorry for him because he was imprisoned. He wanted his readers to see the big picture and realize that it was a benefit for the sake of the gospel that he was a prisoner.

Keep in mind beloved that this Roman imprisonment produced the letters of Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians and Philemon. They all certainly have a place in God's eternal plan to reach sinners like myself with the gospel!&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/91921246"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In verse 1,&lt;b&gt;Paul recognizes the sovereignty of God in his life. &lt;/b&gt;Paul is sitting in a Roman prison cell, arrested under Roman law, but he calls himself &lt;b&gt;the prisoner&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of Jesus Christ (&lt;/b&gt;cp &lt;b&gt;4.1&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;He didnt say the devil put him in prison. Paul is not a victim of circumstances &lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;coincidences; he is an ambassador for Jesus Christ, even while in a prison cell. Cp. &lt;b&gt;Phil 1.12. &lt;/b&gt;Paul is an example of a Spirit filled man that is in complete submission to the will of God for his life when in the line of duty. He would write that &lt;b&gt;The Lord was standing right there by him strengthening him (2 Tim 4.17). &lt;/b&gt;In the service and surrender to Jesus Christ, we must always be aware of His sovereign control and glorious presence &lt;i&gt;even in the midst of the most inglorious circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;

Vs.2 &lt;b&gt;Dispensation of the grace of God- &lt;/b&gt;Stewardship means an administration, or management. The express meaning of this word stewardship is that it is something entrusted to us by the grace of God for the glory of God and the benefit of others.

We see here &lt;b&gt;in verses 2,7,8&lt;/b&gt;, that the origin of the call upon Pauls life, the ability to minister and the very revelation itself was given to him were both attributed to the grace of God.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Any men called into ministry are called to be servants of the grace of God.

Paul did not choose the stewardship of his apostleship or ministry. God had sovereignly commissioned him with the calling, spiritual gifts, opportunities, knowledge, and authority to minister as the apostle to the Gentiles.

Ministry in any capacity is due to &lt;b&gt;the manifold grace of God&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1 Pet 4.10&lt;/b&gt;). Chrstians are people who are saved and then shaped by the grace of God. A life that has been turned upside down by the gospel of Jesus Christ is a life that has been apprehended by the grace of God.

Vs.3-6 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel

&lt;b&gt;By revelation He made known unto me the mystery- &lt;/b&gt;John Stott writes that a biblical mystery &lt;i&gt;is a truth hitherto hidden from human knowledge or understanding but now disclosed by the revelation of God. &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The Holy Spirit revealed to Paul a mysterious truth that not even the greatest prophets understood&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gal 1.10 But I certify you brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 11. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelationof Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 16.25 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1.26,27 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Isaiah 49:6&lt;/b&gt; predicted salvation to all races, but it was Paul who wrote of the fulfillment of that pledge (&lt;b&gt;Acts 13:4647&lt;/b&gt;). It was the truth that in Christ Jesus, the church, which is composed of all the saved since Pentecost, would be united in one body with no racial or social distinctions.

But it was not given to &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;Paul by revelation. It was also given specifically to Peter by revelation (&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=11&amp;amp;v=1-18#s=1029001"&gt;Acts 11:1-18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;) Peter wrote:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Peter 1.10-12 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace &lt;i&gt;that should come&lt;/i&gt; unto you: Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I find it encouraging in my prayers for people who have yet to come to Christ and seem to be the hardest hearts in the world when I realize that God would choose an Orthodox Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Pharisee, and a persecutor of the church to be the main minister of the mystery of the work of the gospel in bringing Jew and Gentile together into one new body.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.7 &lt;b&gt;Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I was made a minister- &lt;/b&gt;No man can make himself a minister (lit., servant) of God, because the calling and empowering of God to be a genuine minister comes from God are it is His prerogative alone to give.

Pauls testimony to King Agrippa regarding his call into the ministry after meeting Jesus Christ on the Damascus Road was &lt;b&gt;Acts 26.16 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, &lt;i&gt;to make thee a minister and a witness&lt;/i&gt; both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 8 &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul was a man that was truly decreasing in order that Jesus would increase.

Compare the progressive chronological revelation in Pauls life from his earliest to latest dated epistles, and observe the pattern of his understanding of Gods grace in his life.&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 15.9 least of the apostles. Eph 3.8 least of the saints. 1 Tim 1.15 chiefest of sinners.&lt;/b&gt;
Paul is not diminishing his calling to be an apostle. Nor is he taking for granted that because of Christs perfect sacrifice, he is now set apart or a saint for the glory of God. As he is growing in Christ, he realizes that he is the chiefest of sinners upon whom, God has chosen to bestow grace and mercy.

One last thing, here is Paul in prison preaching &lt;b&gt;the &lt;i&gt;unsearchable riches of Christ.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;The &lt;b&gt;unsearchable riches &lt;/b&gt;of Jesus are more vast than the universeunreachable means beyond human comprehension.His forgiveness, love, grace, mercy, rest.

The grace of God in Christ is not just something to be received, it is a message that is to be shared with others.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.9 &lt;b&gt;And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, Who created all things by Jesus Christ:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ was the instrument through Whom all things were created.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.10,11 &lt;b&gt;To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly &lt;i&gt;places&lt;/i&gt; might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is through the church that the manifold wisdom of God is manfested to the angelic proncipalities and powers in heaven.

&lt;i&gt;The history of the church and the unfolding drama of redemption is watched with avid interest by the rulers and authorities in heavens, an apparent reference to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;which things the angels desire to look into &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;spoken of by Peter in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;1 Peter 1.12. HCSB&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eternal purpose which He purposed in Christ Jesus before the world began.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Timothy 1.9 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who hath saved us, and called &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.12 &lt;b&gt;In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Every person who comes to Christ in faith can come before God at any time, not in self- confidence but in the Person and finished work of The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.13&lt;b&gt;Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Thess 3.3 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

		<title>Thoughts from a recent Lord&amp;#039;s Supper Message</title>

		<ns3:encoded>1Cor 11.24-26 "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:this is my body, which is broken for you:this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till come."

The Bible is unmistakably clear about two fundamental spiritual realities:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, all human beings are sinners, in fact so hopelessly sinful, so inexcusably guilty and helplessly corrupt, as to be spiritually dead.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Second, Jesus Christ, because of what he has done in his life, death, and resurrection, is the only Savior of sinners able to deliver us from our sin and its consequences. He and he alone is able to make us spiritually alive and sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
No one has ever come to Christ by his own intelligence, will power, or good works. If you are a Christian, it is not because you thought through all of the options and due to your superior intelli- gence and high moral standards, you decided to follow Jesus. Rather, the Bible indicts us all (Rom. 3:10-18):

As it is written, There is none righteous, not even one; there is none who seeks for God; all have turned aside, together they have become useless; there is none who does good, there is not even one. Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they keep deceiving, the poison of asps is under their lips; whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the path of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.

If youre thinking, Well, that may describe others, but it doesnt describe me, then you do not understand Gods grace in the gospel. Jesus did not come to call the righteous but sinners like me to repentance.

Beware of cultural Christianity, where you assume that youre a Christian because you live in a Christian country and attend a Christian church! You are not a Christian unless you know the life-transforming power of God in your heart!

"Take, ... eat,...drink," said Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eating the bread and drinking the cup is personal. No one can eat and drink for you, and no one can have a relationship with Jesus on your behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eating and drinking is symbolic of something that is deeper and inward. It does no good to just be around food or drink. It is of no value at all to rub food or drink on the outside of your body - you must take it in. We must take Jesus unto ourselves inwardly, not merely in an external way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Reader, have you taken Christ into your life as Lord?</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Today we celebrate the resurrection of our glorious Lord Jesus from the dead. As we prepare our hearts to attend our local church celebrations today, how wonderful it is to know that Jesus is alive! When the women came to the tomb, not only was the stone rolled away and the doorway open; the tomb itself was empty. Oh rejoice today dear ones in The One Who rose from the dead, Jesus Christ. Not only did Jesus raise the dead, He Himself is The Resurrection and the life. Remember what Jesus said to Martha? John 11.25 "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life." Let those words of Jesus sink deep down into your heart, beloved. Our precious Lord and Master Jesus is alive. He not only IS the resurrection. He GIVES resurrection life to those who place their faith in Him.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;No power in the universe could keep Jesus in that tomb. The paranoid, religious authorities thought they could seal Jesus inside that tomb. Matthew 27:63 "Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. 64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first." &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;How futile are the efforts of those who try to put a stop to the resurrection of Jesus. When theses very same religious frauds questioned Jesus authority to turn the tables of the money changers in the temple area, He publicly said to them, John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="color: #222222"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;2:19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 21 But he spake of the temple of his body." And indeed, Jesus rose! Oh yes, He is risen!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;It was not possible for the powers of death to hold Jesus in that grave. Acts 2.24 "Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Romans 4.25 tells us that, Jesus was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. The entire Christian faith hinges upon the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor 15.1 "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Glorious day indeed is this Resurrection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="color: #222222"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;Sunday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;. Jesus Christ is risen. Jesus Christ has ascended into glory. Jesus is alive. Praise Him! Adore Him! Go and tell the world that Jesus Christ has conquered sin and death and is Lord!! Hallelujah to The Risen King!!!&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Resurrection Sunday</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Mr 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabbath was past- &lt;/strong&gt;The Jewish day ran from 6PM to 6PM, so this tells us that sometime &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;6 PM on Saturday night, they went to buy these spices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome&lt;/strong&gt;- Luke mentions that Joanna and other women were also there (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 24:10; cf. Mark 15:41&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bought sweet spices to anoint Him- &lt;/strong&gt;That the women came to anoint Jesus body on the third day after his burial showed that they were not expecting to find an empty tomb. Thus, they brought spices to &lt;strong&gt;complete &lt;/strong&gt;the anointing that John records Joseph and Nicodemus had begun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 20:1 &lt;/strong&gt;says that Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb while it was still dark. She may have gone on ahead of the other women.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matthew tells us that these women came to the &lt;strong&gt;tomb late on the Sabbath day as it began to dawn upon the first day of the week. &lt;/strong&gt;Most likely, this is taking place between the hours of 5 and 6 AM.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This particular morning after the Sabbath of Passover week would be known as &lt;em&gt;first fruits&lt;/em&gt;. The meaning of first fruits is that &lt;em&gt;there is more to follow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In addition to the redemptive implications of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is also significant for the believer in that it is the guarantee of our own bodily resurrection and glorification. This is spoken of in great detail in &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 15, &lt;/strong&gt;the resurrection chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How was this large stone rolled away? We know from Matthews gospel that at the time of the resurrection, there was &lt;strong&gt;a great earthquake for the angel of The Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it. (Matt 28.2)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It should be noted that the stone was not rolled away to let Jesus out, but to let the doubting disciples in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The angel who rolled away the stone&lt;strong&gt; (Matt. 28:2), &lt;/strong&gt;had then entered the burial chamber. Luke records that there were two angels in the tomb; Matthew and Mark focus on the one who spoke.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Women were the first to witness the empty tomb and hear from the angel that Jesus was risen (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 28:1-8 ; Lk 24:1-8 ; Jn 20:1-2&lt;/strong&gt; ). The role of women in this account is astonishing since Judaism did not accept the testimony of women as legally valid.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not only was the tomb &lt;em&gt;open, &lt;/em&gt;it was also &lt;em&gt;empty.&lt;/em&gt;In Lukes gospel, the question was asked, &lt;strong&gt;Why seek ye The Living among the dead? &lt;/strong&gt;And the answer to that question is the very central doctrine of the Christian faith. &lt;strong&gt;Jesus Who was crucified is risen&lt;/strong&gt;!!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus Christ is risen! &lt;/strong&gt;Jesus is alive! Jesus IS The Resurrection and the Life! The risen Jesus is why we are here celebrating today. The risen Jesus is why we will gather to celebrate next Sunday, Lord willing. The risen Jesus is Who we live for and love more than anything and anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In a court of law, the testimony of two or three eyewitnesses confirms the validity of something actually taking place.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All 4 gospels and the first chapter of the book of Acts end with the eyewitness testimony of the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and His ascension into heaven.&lt;strong&gt; (Mt 28:2-15; Mr 16:1-11; Lu 24:1-12; John 20:1-18) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mary Magdalene at the tomb, early in the AM (John 20.11-18) Mary Magdalenes name heads the list in all four Gospels.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Peter, a little bit later that same day (Luke 24.34; 1 Cor 15.5)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 disciples of the Emmaus Road. Midday of that same day (Luke 24.13-32). We will see this in verses 12 and 13.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10 disciples in the upper room that evening. Thomas was absent. (Luke 24.36-43; John 20.19-25)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;11 disciples in the upper room 8 days later (John 20.26-29. Thomas is with them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7 disciples on the Sea of Galilee (John 21.1-23)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;11 disciples on a mountain in Galilee (Matt 28.16-20.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;500 brethren at once (1 Cor 15.6)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;James (1 Cor 15.7)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rest of the brethren (1 Cor 15.7)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul on the Road of Damascus (Acts 9; Acts 22; Acts 26)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John on the isle of Patmos around 90 AD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Here are 12 eyewitnesses of the people seeing the Lord Jesus after He rose from the dead. Many of them would end up being martyred for their testimony that Jesus Christ is alive.

It is interesting to me that in His 3 years of public ministry, we read about the miracles of Jesus raising the dead, cleansing lepers, giving sight to the blind, turning water into wine at a wedding feast and feeding a crowd of thousands by miraculously multiplying a little boys lunch of 5 loaves of bread and 2 small fish. In spite of all of these undeniable miracles, the enemies of Jesus asked Jesus for a sign that would prove who He was:

&lt;strong&gt;Matt 12.38-40 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt;

In other words, the grave would be to Jesus Christ what the belly of the fish was to Jonah. Just as Jonah was 3 days and 3 nights in the belly of the great fish, Jesus would be laid in the grave for 3 days and 3 nights.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Just as Jonah came out of the belly of the great fish. Jesus would rise victorious out of the grace and the clutches of death on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. (Luke 24.7). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 2.18-22 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But he spake of the temple of his body. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is at this point that Matthew tells us that some of the guard went that were watching over the tomb of Jesus went and told the chief priests that they had a problem on their hands. &lt;em&gt;The One that they crucified had risen from the dead!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The last thing that these religious leaders wanted was an empty tomb and a Risen Christ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remember, the Jewish rulers had gone to Pilate and secured the sealing of the stone and the setting of the watch over the tomb&lt;strong&gt; (Mt 27:62-66). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matthew tells us that upon hearing of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that these religious leaders then gave a large sum of money to the soldiers and told them to tell others that the reason why Jesus was not in the tomb was because His disciples had come and stolen the body away. &lt;em&gt;In spite of the infallible evidence of His resurrection, these religious people were more concerned with protecting the religious and dead rituals of their ancestors than follow believe in and follow The Risen Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go, tell&lt;/strong&gt; are the two things that all followers of Jesus are to do. Peter is given special mention only in Mark as an encouragement following his denials of Jesus (&lt;strong&gt;Mk. 14:66-72&lt;/strong&gt;). The message for the disciples to meet Jesus in Galilee recalls Jesus prophecy in &lt;strong&gt;Mk.14:28 But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid. 9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils (&lt;/strong&gt;The description out of whom He had driven seven demons comes from &lt;strong&gt;Lk 8:2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mary and the other women ran to the apostles and told them what they had seen and heard. They were mourning and weeping over the loss of their Lord. None of the disciples believed the report of the resurrection of Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are told in the gospel of John that after hearing this report Peter and John run to the tomb. When they arrive at the tomb, it was empty. They only found two separate articles, the linen clothes &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;the napkin. But they still do not know what has taken place.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Johns gospel tells us that when John looked into the empty tomb he found everything neat and in order. Hardly the job of a grave robber.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John also tells us that sometime after the apostles left, Mary was alone weeping when she saw the empty tomb, and that Jesus asked her why she was weeping. For a reason that only God can explain, she thought that Jesus was the gardener and asked him where he took her Lords body. But as soon as Jesus called her by her name Mary, she knew that it was Jesus! Jesus calls His sheep by name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This Emmaus Road account is recorded in great detail in &lt;strong&gt;Luke 24.13-32.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Again, we read about the unbelief of the disciples after these 2 disciples tell them that they saw the resurrected Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judas had committed suicide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why did Jesus rebuke these men? Because they believed not the testimony that He was alive! The Bible says &lt;strong&gt;Today if you hear His voice, harden not your heart. Heb 3.7,8 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John tells us that the 11 had shut themselves in behind closed doors &lt;strong&gt;for fear of the Jews&lt;/strong&gt;. Jesus stood in their midst and said to them Shalom, or Peace be unto you. Jesus showed them His pierced hands and feet.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were troubled and thought that they saw a ghost. Jesus then asks them to give Him a piece of broiled fish to prove that He was not simply a disembodied spirit. Jesus had a physical, resurrected body, but not a body of flesh and blood. It was &lt;strong&gt;the appearance &lt;/strong&gt;of their Resurrected Lord that renewed their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John tells us that Thomas was not with them at this appearance. And he said that &lt;strong&gt;Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eight days later, Jesus (&lt;em&gt;hearing every word that Thomas spoke&lt;/em&gt;) appeared and revealed Himself to Thomas and said, &lt;strong&gt;Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. &lt;/strong&gt;At which time Thomas calls Jesus &lt;strong&gt;My Lord and My God. &lt;/strong&gt;Who is Jesus to you today? Is He your Lord? Your God?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you wondering why your spouse, son or daughter, co-worker or team members who are Christian are always sharing with you the gospel? Here is the answer. It is the command of Jesus to Go and tell!!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gospel means Good News...this good news is for all the world, because &lt;strong&gt;Jesus tasted death for every man. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This gospel or good news is for all people and every ethnic group under heaven, for &lt;strong&gt;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4.12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. &lt;/strong&gt;Would you please note that it is &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;you believe on The Lord Jesus Christ that you can be baptized?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But there is bad news as well. And these are also the words of Jesus Christ. &lt;strong&gt;He that believeth not shall be damned. &lt;/strong&gt;This damnation is eternal. Nobody spoke more about hell than Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to believe on Jesus Christ and be saved? First let me tell you what it &lt;em&gt;does not &lt;/em&gt;mean to believe in Jesus Christ as Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It &lt;em&gt;does not mean &lt;/em&gt;that you believe in God. The bible says that it is the fool who says in his heart, there is not God. To look up at the vast universe or a baby being born leaves one breathless and &lt;em&gt;knowing &lt;/em&gt;that there is a God.

It &lt;em&gt;does not &lt;/em&gt;mean that you believe in a historical figure named Jesus Christ. The bible says that the devils also believe those very same things and tremble.

To believe in The Lord Jesus Christ unto salvation means:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That you repent (&lt;em&gt;be sorry for, turn away from&lt;/em&gt;) of your sin and by faith trust in Christs substitutionary sacrifice on the cross as sole payment of your debt of sin, you will be set free from the guilt and penalty of your sin (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 7:50; 1 Cor 1:18; 2 Cor 2:15; Eph 2:5, 8; 2 Tim 1:9&lt;/strong&gt;). This is what is known as the new birth, or being saved.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It means that you receive Jesus Christ as Lord of your life and The Holy Spirit comes to dwell inside of you and that you will begin to walk in newness of life (&lt;strong&gt;Rom 6:14; 8:2; 2 Cor 3:18; Gal 2:19-20; Phil 1:19; 2:12-13; 2 Th 2:13&lt;/strong&gt;). This is the beginning of a life of repentance. This is becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
The resurrection of Jesus Christ is not about religion, it is about life. Jesus said&lt;strong&gt;, John 10.10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus is The Savior of the world. He is not &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;of the ways to heaven; He is The Only Way to heaven. Jesus Christ gives us life, not mere existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A Roman jailer once asked the apostle Paul and Silas a very important question. &lt;strong&gt;Acts 16.30,31 Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 10.8 The word is nigh thee, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Note that your confession unto salvation is that Jesus Christ is LORD! We do not make Jesus Lord, we receive Him as Lord of our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11.28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Will you place all of your trust for the salvation of your eternal soul to The Lord Jesus Christ today? Your good works cannot atone for your sin and save your soul. Your observing of church rituals cannot atone for your sin and save your soul.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Biblical salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, to the glory of God alone. I bid you todayto be reconciled to God through faith in Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;I want to take a moment to say thank you to each and every one of my blog subscribers. I was gently "pushed" by a couple of men in our church family to write some spiritual insights to bless God's people. I reluctantly accepted their admonition and have been humbled, and amazed by your loving and gracious response. Almost every blog is the overflow of my daily reading God's Word and something "jumping out" of the pages of sacred Scripture.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;I hope that each of you had a Spirit filled, Father magnifying, Christ exalting Day celebrating the resurrection of our glorious Lord Jesus. He is exalted, forever exalted!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Much love in Jesus,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Pastor Ray&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Ephesians 3.14-21</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/ephesians-3-14-21/</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;The Apostle Paul had a great love for the Church at Ephesus; and this love was manifested in his prayers for them. That they would be filled with the fullness of God, and thatGod would be supremely glorified in and through them. Are our lives being filled or being fooled? Are we rooted in love or rotting in routine? This prayer is one every Christian can pray for themselves and for others. May jesus be glorified in and through us and His Church.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15. Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16. That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/93148041"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18. May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 19. And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. 20. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 21. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;

There are two prayers of Paul in Ephesians (here and in 1:1523). They complement each other. The first is a prayer for enlightenment; the second is for enablement. Paul wants the Ephesians to learn all they have in Christ and then live what they have learned.

I know a lot of people who have a wealth of bible knowledge in their head, but it has yet to drop that 18 inches into their hearts. I suggest to you that happens through prayer. Pauls prayer in the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; chapter is that the theology of everything else that he has taught them this far would make its way from their head to their heart.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this cause&lt;/strong&gt;- We see here in verse 14 that Paul uses the same words, &lt;strong&gt;for this cause&lt;/strong&gt; that he used when he began this chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cause that Paul is speaking about refers to the revelation that God gave to him regarding the bringing together of Jew and Gentile, through Messiah Yeshua into one new man, the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not only did Paul desire that each one of these saints in Ephesus understand what this great mystery of Jew and Gentile in Messiah meant doctrinally. His breathtaking prayer here is that each and every one of these dear saints experience a deeper fellowship with The Father, through faith in Jesus Christ, in the power of The Holy Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul knew (and I hope that you and I know) that doctrine &lt;em&gt;about &lt;/em&gt;God apart from a true relationship &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;God is nothing but a cold, impersonal religion. A form of godliness with no life. No power. God has not sent His Son to die for our sin and given unto us the revelation of His Word and the Holy Spirit to merely know about Him. The Christian faith is knowing our Lord personally and having a growing relationship with Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
o &lt;strong&gt;John 17.3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/strong&gt;

o &lt;strong&gt;Jer 9.23,24 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; glory in his might, let not the rich &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; I delight, saith the LORD.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I bow my knees- &lt;/strong&gt;Bowing the knees is one of the many bodily positions for prayer that are recorded in Scripture. Other prayer postures that are mentioned are sitting, standing, lying down or on your face to name a few. May we never forget that the most important position in prayer is the position of your heart, not if you are praying sitting, lying, kneeling, or standing. You can standing with your hands lifted up like the Pharisee in Luke 18, but if you regard iniquity in your heart, your prayer is going nowhere.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We know that in Pauls day, the most common position of prayer was standing. Only in cases of extreme need or times of consecration or dedication unto God would be seen bowing a knee. Bending your knee was a sign of great reverence and submission, recognizing that you were in total dependence on the one to whom you were bowing. And this is the position that Paul takes when interceding for the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What motivated Paul to pray for these people? It was his deep love for the people of God and his desire to see them grow in Christ and live for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of the greatest expressions of your love for others is revealed in your prayers for them. One of the greatest investments in the spiritual growth of others is your prayers for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15. Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whole family &lt;/strong&gt;means that all saints in earth and Heaven constitute one great family of born-again ones, of whom God is the Father. Like our physical birth, we do not give ourselves spiritual birth, we owe our spiritual birth into the body of Christ to the grace of God. &lt;strong&gt;John 1.13&lt;/strong&gt; reads, &lt;strong&gt;we are born, not of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are born into this beautiful family of God by grace through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
o &lt;strong&gt;Titus 3.5,6 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The only difference between the family of God that is in heaven and the family of God that is on earth is that they are now perfect, and we are not. Like any earthly family, the family of God on earth has its problems, dont we?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The family of God a living organism, not an organization or any one particular system. This family is also a body, with only One Head, The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can be baptized into a religious organization on earth, but you must be born into the family of heaven and earth. You can become a member of a religious organization on earth, but to enter the kingdom of God, &lt;strong&gt;you must be born again&lt;/strong&gt;. Have you experienced that new birth by grace through faith in Jesus Christ? Are you in Christ today? Turn any question mark into an exclamation point by calling upon the Name of The Lord today? Repent and believe on The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;16. That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul is asking Abba to grant abundantly unto His church a gift corresponding to the riches of His glory. And this first request is for strength in the inner man.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner man- &lt;/strong&gt;the interior of our being...the seat of personal consciousness...[and] of our moral being. The inner man, beloved, is the focal point of a persons life. It is our hearts, souls and minds. That is where the Holy Spirit dwells and does His strengthening and renewing work. Your inner man is the sanctuary of God in your soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
o &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 hidden man of the heart.&lt;/strong&gt;

o &lt;strong&gt;Romans 7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22; 2 Cor 4.16 the inward man.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some people have an idea that a Christian is a walking storage battery. You hear people pray, O God, give me more power, fill me with power. The idea they have is that the old battery is pretty well run down. Put another one in, Lord, is what they seem to say. No, you are not a storage battery; you are in connection with the great eternal dynamo, and the Holy Spirit works in and through you to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ as you yield yourself to Him. He Himself is the source of all power, and that power is to be used by the people of God. &lt;/em&gt;Dr Harry Ironsides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that the people that Paul is praying for are the same ones that read about in chapter 1 who have been chosen by The Father, redeemed by The Son and sealed with The Holy Ghost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why does Paul pray this way? Dont they already have Christ dwelling in their hearts? Yes, but Gods will for each one of us is to grow up spiritually. A baby is cute for a while, but when a 15 year old is wearing diapers and saying goo-goo ga-ga something is wrong!!!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith- &lt;/strong&gt;The verb &lt;strong&gt;to dwell&lt;/strong&gt; here literally means, to settle down, as opposed to to sojourn. Jesus Christ enters into our lives and we enter into His body by faith. This is the prayer that Jesus Christ would dwell or be seated as Lord upon the throne of our hearts, ruling and reigning over every word that comes out of our mouths and all that we do for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God is not expecting sinless perfection in this life, but He is looking for a sincere and honest desire to grow in Christ. Thus, we need to continually draw our strength to walk in holiness and power from Christs indwelling within us.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Just as our physical bodies need our hearts to continually be pumping blood through our body for our bodies to live, so we need a continual flow of the grace and presence of Christ in order that we can truly live for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooted and grounded- rooted &lt;/strong&gt;as trees in a deep, fruitful soil, &lt;strong&gt;grounded &lt;/strong&gt;as a building on a rock. And what is it that we are to rooted and grounded in? The love of God for us, for &lt;strong&gt;God is love. &lt;/strong&gt;This love of God was so beautifully manifested on that middle cross of Mount Calvary.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are to be rooted in the love of God for us, with the overflow of our lives being a God-centered love, beloved. As the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, The Name of Jesus is exalted and The Father is glorified.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The love of God is the greatest virtue that Christian and any local church can have. According to Jesus Christ, the greatest commandments of entire Old Testament are to love God supremely and to love our neighbor as ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When our local churchindividually and congregationally is motivated by the love of God in the way that we talk to one another, and listen to one another, and give, and pray and serve, and forgive, we have everything. Without being motivated by the love of Christ in all of these areas, we can have great buildings, excellent doctrine, impressive websites, but according to 1 Cor 13 and Revelation 2.4, our churchis a big fat ZERO that has left its first love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18. May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This speaks of the immeasurable dimensions of Gods love for us. In other words, we will never be able to say that we have fully comprehend or experienced the love of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19. And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To know the love of Christ that passes knowledge- &lt;/strong&gt;Did you catch that, dear ones? Paul prays that we may know the unknowable. To know this love of Christ is not speaking of arriving at an intellectual discovery. It is a revelation of the love of God in Christ that was manifested on Calvary. It is something that God gives to us via revelation by spending time with Him in prayer and precious communion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filled with all the fullness of God. &lt;/strong&gt;More about that in a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How many times do we place our human limitations on God? As human beings, we are prone to place things in categories: that is very easy, that is simple, no problem, oh that is pretty tough, that one is difficult. Hey, that is impossible. We are prone to carry these human limitations over to God in prayer. How many times in our attitude of prayer, "Lord, this is a simple thing. You can handle this one. Lord, this is pretty tough. I really don't know. Forget it, Lord. It is impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, our God is El Shaddai, The Almighty God! His vast power far exceeds our needs, our expectations, our positive confessions and our prayers. The greatest of my prayers and thoughts are the very least of what God can do. The Puritans used to say prayer can do what God can do.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 32.26,27 Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying, Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jer 33.3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is your Jeremiah 33.3 today? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; is your Jeremiah 33.3 today? Beloved, do not measure your present crisis, or difficulty or need by your limited resources. Cast your burden upon The Lord, and He shall sustain you.

&lt;strong&gt;21- Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The glory of God is the beauty and brightness of his infinite perfections. When your heart breaks out in the words, "Glory to God," it's like a football team carrying their coach off the field on their shoulders; or like a standing ovation at Orchestra Hall.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The glory of God is one of the most wonderful themes in all of Scripture. But when Paul or anybody else in Scripture is talking about the glory of God, know that beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are not only &lt;em&gt;talking about the doctrine&lt;/em&gt; of the glory of God, they are fascinated by, and praising and worshipping The God of all glory!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Two things jump out at me in this prayer. They are the two phrases &lt;strong&gt;the fullness of God&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the glory of God&lt;/strong&gt; that send Paul into doxology orbit! The fullness of God is specifically mentioned in verse 19. The glory of God is most certainly implied in verse 21.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Think about those two phrases for a moment. Now ponder in your heart what those two phrases mean. Now ask yourself a couple of questions. Is the deepest desire of your heart right now to be filled with the fullness of God? Is the greatest desire in every single area of your life to live for the glory of God?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What kind of an changes do you think praying to be filled with the fullness of God and asking God to show you His glory would have on your Christian life?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How might praying that prayer change your perspective or priorities in life?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How might praying that prayer affect the decisions that you make in life vocationally, financially, relationally? How you use your time?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How might our church family be changed and the gospel be spread if each and every one of us sought to be filled with the fullness of God in order that we might live for His glory and honor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Think of it beloved, what could possibly be more fulfilling or satisfying in life here on earth than being filled with the fullness of God?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1.16 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Col 1.19 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For it pleased &lt;em&gt;the Father&lt;/em&gt; that in him should all fulness dwell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To be filled with the fullness of Christ means to be filled with His presence, His goodness, His beauty, His grace, and His pleasures. What or who can possibly be more fulfilling than this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Have you ever seen a person driven by a purpose of winning a race, acing that exam, landing a job? Nothing gets in the way. What purpose in life could be more glorious than living for the glory of God?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Chron 29.11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thine, O LORD, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all &lt;em&gt;that is&lt;/em&gt; in the heaven and in the earth &lt;em&gt;is thine&lt;/em&gt;; thine &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isa 6.3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the LORD of hosts: the whole earth &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; full of his glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt 6.13 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rom 11.36 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For of him, and through him, and to him, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; all things: to whom &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; glory for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rom 16.27 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To God only wise, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Pet 3.18 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But grow in grace, and &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; glory both now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jude 24,25 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 5.11-13 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truths sake.&lt;/strong&gt; (Psalm 115.1). May each one of you be filled with the fullness of God for the glory of God today!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As we connect these two phrases into one closing thought, we realize that the divine purpose for us individually, our families and our church family is that we be a people who desire to be filled with the fullness of God more than anything else or anyone else in order that we might live for the glory of God.

This God of Glory sent His Son Jesus to die a substitutionary death on the cross for our sin. Have you cried out to Jesus to receive the forgiveness for your sin? Have you received Him and confessed Him as Lord of your life? But He also sent His Son to deliver us from pursuing a self-centered life, that is a dead end street of emptiness. &lt;strong&gt;What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&lt;/strong&gt;

Is there anything or anyone or earth that is worth losing your own soul?

One day, every single person who ever lived on planet earth will bend their knee to Christ as Lord. All will recognize not only that He indeed is God, but also that they owed their allegiance to Him as Lord. Just as Paul said in Phil. 2:9-10, &lt;strong&gt;Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth. &lt;/strong&gt;Have you bowed the knee of your heart, your mind and your will to the Lord Jesus Christ?

		<title>Galathians 3.10-14 - The Lord&amp;#039;s Supper</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;The New Testament correlates faith and grace to make sure that we do not boast in what grace alone achieves. Faith is the act of our soul that turns away from our own insufficiency to the free and all-sufficient resources of God. Faith focuses on the freedom of God to dispense grace to the unworthy. Faith boasts in The Lord Jesus, nothing else and nobody else.&lt;/em&gt;

The idea of redemption brings to light an insurmountable need on the part of those being redeemed. There is a reason for redemption. Paul couches the need for redemption in the language of a "curse." The Bible declares that we are all sinners who are born in Adam. Because of that, we live under a curse of infinite proportions that we are helpless to remove by our own efforts. &lt;em&gt;Only by the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, can sinners be delivered from the curse.&lt;/em&gt;

Verses 10-14 provide the contrast from the saving faith of believing Abraham (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gal&amp;amp;c=3&amp;amp;v=9#s=1094009"&gt;Galatians 3:9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) to those who are seeking to get right with God by &lt;strong&gt;the works of the law&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law (&lt;/strong&gt;lit. &lt;em&gt;all who are depending upon their own obedience to the Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) are under the curse: for it is written (De 27:26), Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

Paul is dealing with the Galatian heresy espoused by the Judaizers who tried to lure the church in Galatia into embracing Judaism as supreme over the sufficiency of faith in Christ.

They sought to bring the Galatians, both Jew and Gentile, into a bondage of dependence upon the works of the Law as the means of justification. In response to this threat of damnable legalism, the apostle Paul plants his feet firmly into the true meaning of salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.

The Judaizers believed and taught that the Law carried more weight than the cross. As a result of that way of thinking, they were hanging on to their own ability to keep the Law as the way to God rather than faith in Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
Continuing his thought that we are justified by the grace of God and not by the keeping of the law, Paul shows here that it is spiritual suicide to think that you can be justified in the sight of God by keeping the law because &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; who seek to approach God &lt;em&gt;through it&lt;/em&gt; will inevitably be cursed, not blessed from God.

The word &lt;strong&gt;curse&lt;/strong&gt; here means, &lt;em&gt;to be condemned and doomed to punishment by the righteous judgment of God&lt;/em&gt;.
Why? Because if you attempt to be made right with God by human effort, there is no room for one single error; if you break &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the commands of God, you have broken the entire law.

o &lt;strong&gt;Jas 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.&lt;/strong&gt;

The law demanded entire obedience. He who violated one commandment was guilty of all. "&lt;em&gt;The law is not a collection of stray and miscellaneous parts, some of which may conveniently be disregarded. It is a whole, and must be kept in all its parts if it is to be considered kept at all&lt;/em&gt;"

Not a single person on this Lords Supper Sunday should be under any illusion or so self-deceived as to think we are able to perfectly obey at all times and in all ways every aspect of the law. Jesus teaching regarding the true meaning of adultery and murder in the Sermon on the Mount makes this even clearer. Thinking the thoughts of adultery and murder indicate that we are fallen sinners who need a Redeemer for our sin debt.

Both the books of Galatians and Hebrews reveal to us that the law was intended by God to show us our inadequacy to keep it and our need of His saving grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. The law was never intended to make men righteous.

o &lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

o &lt;strong&gt;Heb 7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.&lt;/strong&gt;

If Gods holy, perfect law could not justify us in the sight of God, but only declare us guilty and point us to the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, how can any person, &lt;em&gt;now that Jesus has come and fulfilled all of the holy and righteous requirements of God&lt;/em&gt;, really believe that their salvation can be obtained by their keeping of the rituals or rules of their denomination? Its absurd, its heresy, its impossible. Its works, and not grace.

Biblical salvation is not Jesus plus ritual, or works. Biblical salvation from A to Z is all of grace, not or works lest any man should boast.
Would you be totally honest with yourself at this point? Are you clinging to your own adherence to the Ten Commandments or the Golden Rule or some other standard of morality as your means of being justified before God?

The whole intent of the epistle to the Galatians is to explain to you that God will not accept your attempt at obeying the law for righteousness. As much as you try, as much effort as you give, you can never meet up to God's standard; which is perfection.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11 But that no man is justified (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;declared righteous and brought into right standing with God&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

To the believers in Rome, Paul wrote &lt;strong&gt;Ro 3:19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.&lt;/strong&gt;

The law declares all mankind guilty before God and renders it impossible for any man to be counted justified in the sight of God by trying to follow the law of Moses, no matter how good or sincere he or she is or how much good he or she does.

Having shown from the Old Testament that the law inevitably brings a curse upon fallen humanity, Paul now shows that the same Old Testament scriptures also revealed a way for sinful man to enter into a right relationship with God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habakkuk 2:4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;proud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Three times we find this phrase, &lt;strong&gt;the just shall live by faith in the New Testament. &lt;/strong&gt;Here in Galatians and
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ro 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In quoting &lt;strong&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/strong&gt; Paul shows that salvation by obedience the law is pride and contrary to the message of grace.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rom 4.2-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath &lt;em&gt;whereof&lt;/em&gt; to glory; but not before God. 3For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 4Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rom &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.6,7 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if by grace, then &lt;em&gt;is it&lt;/em&gt; no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if &lt;em&gt;it be&lt;/em&gt; of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Pride in whatever I do to &lt;em&gt;make myself right in the sight of God&lt;/em&gt; only proves that I have not comprehended the grace of Christ and am &lt;em&gt;not right&lt;/em&gt; in the sight of God.

&lt;em&gt;The grace of God isnt something that is earned; it is Someone Who is received&lt;/em&gt;. The only way to enter into a vital relationship with The Lord and live a life that is pleasing to Him is by faith.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 11:6, "but without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 And the law is not of faith: but, the man that doeth them shall live in them.&lt;/strong&gt;

Seeking to be accepted by God on the basis of complete obedience to the law is not an act of faith in God, but a nullifying of the grace of Christ and an act of arrogant pride. Salvation according to a religious person is always rooted in &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; and upon the basis of what they have done or dont do instead of trusting in the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lu 18:9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Like this self-righteous Pharisee, it is only a proud person this morning who believes that they can be good enough to stand before God upon the basis of their own self-justifying religious activity or good works instead of total trust in the saving work of Christ alone.

A proud person cannot accept that his or her own depravity makes them just as guilty before God as any other person on this planet right now.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word for the English word redeemed is "exagorazo" and it means to purchase for oneself by the payment of their debt.

Please note that Jesus and Jesus alone redeemed us from the curse of the law.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 19 &lt;em&gt;But with the precious blood of Christ&lt;/em&gt;, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Religion substitutes good works, rituals or religious service for the holy blood of Jesus Christ, which is the only God approved price of redemption.

&lt;strong&gt;being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul quotes &lt;strong&gt;Deuteronomy 21:23&lt;/strong&gt; in referring to what happened when Christ died upon the cross. Christ took upon Himself the curse of sin when He suffered the penalty of sin and death for us. (&lt;strong&gt;Is. 53:1-11; John 1:29&lt;/strong&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mt 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the price paid to set them free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Ti 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2Co 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in and through Him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Like the symbolic scapegoat spoken of in&lt;strong&gt; Lev 16:5-26, &lt;/strong&gt;Jesus was the representative of the legal payment of the sin and the curse that it required.
The Bible declares that The LORD is both a God of justice and of mercy: On the surface, mercy and justice seem to oppose each other. But the gospel of Jesus Christ clearly reveals that God can show both mercy and justice at the same time. Because on the cross, Jesus took the punishment we deserve, God's justice is satisfied. At the same time, He shows mercy by extending the work of Jesus to us as payment for our sins. Only God can reconcile mercy and justice, that He might be &lt;strong&gt;just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus (Romans 3:26).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

The New Testament emphasizes what God has done for us. The Church has made the mistake of emphasizing what we should do for God, and in doing so, we have drifted away from a life of faith, grace and fruit in the power of The Holy Spirit to the life of law, works, and flesh.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Hebrews 9:27,28)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This verse poses a very important question before us all: Are we included in the many whose sins he bore?

The answer of Hebrews 9:28 is, Yes, if we are &lt;em&gt;eagerly, constantly, and patiently] waiting for and expecting Him&lt;/em&gt;. We can know that our sins are taken away and that we will be safe in the judgment if we trust Christ in such a way that effects the way that we live and we are daily earnestly awaiting for His coming.

There is a phony faith that claims to believe in Christ, but is only a fire insurance policy. Phony faith believes only to escape hell. It has no real desire for Christ. In fact, it would prefer it if he did not come, so that we can have as much of this worlds pleasures as possible. This shows that a heart is not with Christ, but with the world.

When you know Jesus, you follow Him; when you do not know Jesus, you may glance at Him from time to time, but in reality, on a day-by-day basis, you do your own thing and sprinkle your religious spin to it to make yourself look good before others.So the issue for us is: Do we eagerly long for the coming of Christ? Or do we want him to wait while our love affair with the world runs its course? That is the question that tests the authenticity of faith.

So let us be like the Corinthians who were &lt;strong&gt;awaiting eagerly the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 1:7)&lt;/strong&gt;, and like the Philippians whose &lt;strong&gt;citizenship was in heaven, from which also [they] eagerly waited for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:20).&lt;/strong&gt;

Thats the issue before us, beloved. Do we love His appearing? Or do we love the world and hope that His appearing will not interrupt our worldly plans? Eternity hangs on this question.
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
The New Testament correlates faith and grace to make sure that we do not boast in what grace alone achieves. Faith is the act of our soul that turns away from our own insufficiency to the free and all-sufficient resources of God. Faith focuses on the freedom of God to dispense grace to the unworthy. Faith boasts in The Lord Jesus, nothing else and nobody else.

The bread and the cup is all about Jesus. The Christian life beloved is not about me, its not about you, its not about us, its all about Jesus Christ. Its all about trusting Him, serving Him and eagerly looking for His glorious appearance.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 3:24 Being justified (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;made upright and in right standing with God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) freely by His grace (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unmerited favor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Tim 1.12 for I know (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not simply know about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) whom I have believed (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;adhered to and trusted in and relied on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Do not settle for just knowing about Jesus - choose today to follow Him with all of your heart. If you would like to receive Christ as Lord today, we would love to pray with you. &lt;a href="mailto:contact@koinoniafellowship.com"&gt;Email us&lt;/a&gt;.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Why does Jesus give gifts to the His Church? Is it for our own personal enjoyment? Paul say NO! The gifts Jesus gives are for God's glory, for the building up of the Church, to unite us, to mature us, and to be rooted in love. Be encouraged by this truth as we dig deep into the word of God.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 13 exhorts us to walk in such a way that maintains the unity of The Spirit in the bond of peace.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 4-6 describes 7 absolutes upon which our unity in Christ rests.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 711 describes the ascension ministry gifts of Jesus Christ which are given for the equipping and edification of the body of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 1216 deal with the goal or purpose of the ascension ministry gifts to the church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
God is the God of grace because He is the God Who freely gives. His giving of gifts and the ability to use them has nothing to do with anything we have done, but is unmerited, unearned, and undeserved. &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/96583404"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt 25.15 And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took His journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 4.10 As every man hath received the gift, &lt;em&gt;even so&lt;/em&gt; minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Because every ministry gift and the fruit of that gift stems from Gods grace, all the boasting and glory belongs to the Gift Giver, not the recipient of the gift. In our physical bodies, our hands function differently than our eyes, which function differently than our toes. So, too, in the body of Christ. Although we are one body, each part of the body is designed by God to function in a unique way according to the gift each has been given. That is a wonderful picture of the beauty of expression within the various parts of the body of Christ whether within the local body or universally.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This is a quote from&lt;strong&gt; Psalm 68. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 68&lt;/strong&gt;is a victory hymn that was composed by David to celebrate Gods conquest of the Jebusite city of Jerusalem and the triumphant ascent of God up to Mount Zion (cf. &lt;strong&gt;2 Sam. 67; 1 Chron. 13&lt;/strong&gt;). After such a triumph, the king would bring home the spoils and the prisoners. Paul sees this Psalm as prefiguring Christs returning from His battle on earth and victorious ascension into heaven with the trophies of his great victory at Calvary. &lt;strong&gt;Colossians 2:15&lt;/strong&gt;tells us that Jesus openly defeated the powers of darkness on the cross; but it was at His ascension that His victory was completed. According to &lt;strong&gt;Romans 1.4&lt;/strong&gt;, the resurrection of Jesus Christ completed the proof of His being the Son of God. When Jesus Christ ascended to the right hand of The Father, Our blessed Redeemer, The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;strong&gt; led captivity captive and He gave gifts unto men.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;He gave gifts unto men- &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word for gifts is &lt;em&gt;doma&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;charisma&lt;/em&gt;. There is a listing of gifts in &lt;strong&gt;Romans 12&lt;/strong&gt;, commonly known as the motivational gifts, and the charismatic gifts in &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; talking about the charismatic or motivational gifts that are given by the Holy Spirit to each believer. He is referring to the &lt;em&gt;doma &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;domatic &lt;/em&gt;gifts, or &lt;em&gt;what is known &lt;/em&gt;as the ascension ministry gifts. They refer to men who have been gifted by Jesus Christ to minister to His body, the church. These offices are the fruit of the ascension of Jesus Christ. Thus, ministry is a divine calling, not a career. God, not man, calls and placesmen into these offices, with or without seminary or bible school training. A degree from a seminary or bible school may provide you with academic accreditation but only God can call you into ministry.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 4.10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Prior to the death of Jesus Christ, hell was divided into twocompartments, as is told by Jesus in &lt;strong&gt;Luke 16.&lt;/strong&gt;There was a fixed gulf between the two that was uncrossable.One side was a place of torment, while theother was a place of comfort, overseen byAbraham, or as the bible calls it, Abrahams Bosom. The Old Testament sacrifices could not put away sins,only cover them and look forward to better things tocome as we learn in the book of Hebrews. It took the perfect sacrifice of the sinless Lamb of God, Jesus Christy to put away sin. Thus,those who believed in the promise of God to send theMessiah were saved by their faith, but could not be brought into the heavenly scene until the perfectsacrifice of Jesus was accomplished. In Hebrew thinking, everyone who died went to Hades (&lt;em&gt;sheol&lt;/em&gt;), the abode of the dead. If you were righteous, Hades was a place of delight. If you were wicked, Hades was a place of torment. Hades was a catch-all term. Jesus did not go to hell in the sense of fire and brimstone while his body was in the tomb. As horrible as hell, the place of the damned is, we must remember that hell and death will be cast into the lake of fire after the great white throne judgment. Thus, the phrase, &lt;strong&gt;descended into the lower parts of the earth&lt;/strong&gt; does not mean that Jesus went to the place of the damned. He did not go to the place of torment called Hell; and although some churches teach this doctrine, it is not Biblical. Remember what he told the thief on the cross&lt;strong&gt;? Today you will be with Me in Paradise. (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 23:43&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;John 13:1&lt;/strong&gt;records that Jesus knew that it was time to ascend to the Father. So we know that when Jesus gave up His spirit on the cross (&lt;strong&gt;John 19:30&lt;/strong&gt;), He went into and emptied that compartment known as Abrahams bosom (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 16:22&lt;/strong&gt;), leading all the saints from there up to glory or paradise.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 12.4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 2.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So what does it mean that He came first to the lower parts of the earth? &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 139:15 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth&lt;/strong&gt;.Here David used that phrase to describe His earthly birth. Jesus left heaven and was born on earth. That was His Incarnation. &lt;strong&gt;Matt 12:40 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&lt;/strong&gt; Here the reference was a prophecy of Jesus burial after the crucifixion. So Jesus came to live on this earth for 33 years, was crucified, buried  put into the earth for three days (the sign of Jonah  &lt;strong&gt;Matt 12:39&lt;/strong&gt;); On the third day, Jesus physically busted out of that tomb and ascended up to the Father. So the one who descended is Jesus, who is now at the right hand of God (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 1:20; Heb 12:2&lt;/strong&gt;). What was the purpose of all of this?&lt;strong&gt; That He might fill all things! &lt;/strong&gt;What could possibly be mode glorious than being filled with the fullness of Jesus Christ? Verses 11-16 form one long sentence in the Greek text.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apostles- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a sent one; a delegate, envoy, or messenger&lt;/em&gt;. A term used particularly of the 12 disciples who had seenthe risen Christ (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 1:22&lt;/strong&gt;), including Matthias, who replaced Judas. Later, Paul was uniquely set apart as the Apostle to the Gentiles (&lt;strong&gt;Gal. 1:1517&lt;/strong&gt;) and was numbered with the other apostles. He, too, miraculously encountered Jesus at his conversion on the Damascus Road (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 9:19; Gal. 1:1517&lt;/strong&gt;). Those apostles were chosen directly by Christ, so as to be called apostles of Jesus Christ (&lt;strong&gt;Gal. 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1&lt;/strong&gt;). They were given three basic responsibilities: &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; to lay the foundation of the church (&lt;strong&gt;Eph. 2:20&lt;/strong&gt;); &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; to receive, declare, and write Gods word (3:5; &lt;strong&gt;Acts 11:28 21:1011&lt;/strong&gt;); and&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; to give confirmation of that word through signs, wonders, and miracles (&lt;strong&gt;2 Cor. 12:12; cf. Acts 8:67; Heb. 2:34&lt;/strong&gt;).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 16.20 And they (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the apostles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You do not read in the book of Acts that every single believer was walking around laying hands on the sick and performing signs and wonders. There are no A Apostles today. &lt;strong&gt;Prophets- &lt;/strong&gt;By strict definition, a prophet is an inspired speaker who forth-tells the word of God under the anointing of Gods Spirit. The gift of a prophet was a gift in which one received direct revelatory messages from God that could forth tell Gods Word and foretell Gods future. According to &lt;strong&gt;Eph 2.20,&lt;/strong&gt; Apostles and prophets are foundational for the churchs work. In &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 14.3&lt;/strong&gt;, we read that whenever a person speaks prophetically, it will be to edify, to exhort, or to comfort. There are New Testament references to prophets in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 13:1, 11:27, 28, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21:10&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, its important to make a distinction between the &lt;em&gt;office&lt;/em&gt; of a prophet, and &lt;em&gt;the ability to prophes&lt;/em&gt;y. To prophesy is one of the gifts found in &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 12:8-10&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Spirit of God can come upon any individual in the body of Christ and enable them to speak forth an inspired word. That doesnt mean, however, that they are a prophet. For example, in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 21:8,9&lt;/strong&gt;we see that Philip the evangelist &lt;strong&gt;had four virgin daughters who prophesied&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesnt mean they were prophets, but they were using the gift of prophecy that the prophet Joel had foretold, as Peter quoted in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: ... I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ... and your daughters shall prophecy&lt;/strong&gt;. There are still prophets today in the body of Christ, but keep these guidelines in mind:
&lt;h2&gt;How can you identify a False Prophet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never in a prophetic word will the gospel of Jesus Christ be altered.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never in a prophetic word will there be an added revelation to the completed canon of Scripture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never in a prophetic word will the revealed will of God be contradicted.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never in a prophetic word will someone say, Give me money. That is a false prophet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Evangelists- &lt;/strong&gt;There are also evangelists, who are those who bring good tidings. I would say there are capital E Evangelists and small e evangelists. Examples of Evangelists in the Scriptures would be Philip, Timothy, Paul, and other Apostles. In our lifetime weve also had Evangelists, such as Billy or Franklin Graham and Greg Laurie. However, every child of God, in one way, shape, or form, is also called to be an evangelist. We are called to bring the Good News of Jesus Christ wherever we go  to work, school, the marketplace, etc. Were to be the people whose feet are &lt;strong&gt;shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eph 6:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;. We are to herald the Good News of salvation through Jesus Christ. &lt;strong&gt;Pastors and Teachers-&lt;/strong&gt;The word pastor can also mean to shepherd, or to tend, as in Jesus instructions to Peter &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 21:15-17&lt;/strong&gt;, and Peters exhortation to the church elders to &lt;strong&gt;feed&lt;/strong&gt; (shepherd) &lt;strong&gt;the flock of God which is among you&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 5:2&lt;/strong&gt;). And one of the qualifications for a person to be a pastor is that he be able to teach; thus, a pastor-teacher. Some see a distinction here between the office of pastor and teacher. While it is true that not all who have the gift of teaching are called to be pastors; all pastors are called to be teachers as well. These offices are expressions of the grace of God that He has bestowed upon His people.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the responsibility of these gifts to the church is to equip Gods people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) 4.13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Perfecting&lt;/strong&gt;-The word for equipping usually means fixing something that's broken (&lt;em&gt;as when nets are torn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 4:21&lt;/strong&gt;) or supplying something that is lacking (as in &lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 3:10&lt;/strong&gt;, "&lt;strong&gt;We desire to supply, or equip, what is lacking in your faith&lt;/strong&gt;"). Thus the ascension ministry gifts are not only meant to repair what's broken and supply what's lacking in the believers. They are also meant to edify and strengthen those motivational and charismatic gifts that are in you, so that you may be fully prepared and equipped to minister (serve) in The Name of The Lord and bring Him glory. The church is edified (built up) through the Word of God (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 20:32 &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; 1 Cor. 14:4&lt;/strong&gt;). Churches are not built up and strengthened for spiritual warfare or evangelism through man-made programs, entertainment, recreation, or social events. The church is a spiritual body and &lt;strong&gt;man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.&lt;/strong&gt; It is unfortunate that there is a mentality within the church at large that the men on staff of any church are the only full time ministers, and then there is the rest of you. Picture a &lt;strong&gt;football team &lt;/strong&gt;all huddled around their coach before kick off. A great cheer goes up, then &lt;strong&gt;the coach &lt;/strong&gt;runs out onto the field &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;all the players &lt;/strong&gt;stand on the sidelines &amp;amp; cheer him on. He receives the kick...then gets nailed by 11 opposing tacklers! As foolish as that sounds, that happens when a church picks up on the idea that &lt;strong&gt;the Pastors &lt;/strong&gt;are the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;paid professionals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; are the ones to be doing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the work of the ministry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;! While it is indeed true that some are called by God to serve Him full time &lt;em&gt;vocationally, &lt;/em&gt;every Christian is called and equipped by God to serve Him full time. In &lt;strong&gt;verse 13 Unity of the faith&lt;/strong&gt;- Paul is not talking about a structural or organizational unity, but a spiritual unity around a common faith. We shall never fully come to the perfect man, until we arrive in glory.This unity of the body of Christ is not to be understood as in the World Council of churches, which is ecumenical, and a part of the great Whore of Babylon.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In &lt;strong&gt;verse 14&lt;/strong&gt;, we learn that another purpose for the ascension ministry gifts is in order that the body of Christ would have the discernment to know false teachers and their false teachings. By &lt;strong&gt;the sleight of men&lt;/strong&gt;; this is a metaphor taken from gamesters, and signifies the mischievous subtlety of seducers. The Bible warns that in the last days people &lt;strong&gt;will not endure sound doctrin&lt;/strong&gt;e, but will follow teachers who will tell them what they want to hear (&lt;strong&gt;2 Tim 4:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;). Paul warned the Ephesian elders about these false teachers (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 20:30&lt;/strong&gt;). So did Peter in &lt;strong&gt;2 Peter 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Thus, one of the most important functions of the role of pastor-teacher is the responsibility before God to instruct and warn the people of God of the many isms, and the heretical winds of doctrines and teachings being proclaimed.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaking the truth in love.&lt;/strong&gt; Love is an excellent thing; but it must be blended with truth. Truth is an excellent thing; yet it is necessary that we speak it in love. Both knowledge and love are crucial. Knowledge without love puffs up, Paul said (&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 8:1&lt;/strong&gt;). But love without knowledge is confused and aimless, and disintegrates into sentimentality. That's why Paul prays in &lt;strong&gt;Philippians 1:9 "that your love might abound more and more in all knowledge and discernment."&lt;/strong&gt; Love abounding in knowledge and discernment is what builds up the body of Christ. The word truth isnt heard much in our society anymore. Present thinking is that truth is relative, or that the truth is whatever you believe. No its not! What you believe does not define what is true or real. Gods truth is not relative, but universal and unchangeable. Many people reject the concepts of only one faith and a singular, absolute truth. But God declares (and its emphatic in the Greek language) that there is THE faith (&lt;strong&gt;Jude 3&lt;/strong&gt;), and THE truth (&lt;strong&gt;John 17.17&lt;/strong&gt;). The Bible states there is only one true faith and the God of Scripture is the only God of truth (&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 45:22, 65:16&lt;/strong&gt;). There is only one true gospel (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 1:6-8&lt;/strong&gt;). When we share the gospel with the lost, we must NEVER compromise the truth, but neither should we speak the truth in an unloving way. &lt;strong&gt;2 Tim 2:25 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:26 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.&lt;/strong&gt; What delivers souls out of the realm of darkness and death? Gods truth or the truth about God. Paul wrote that God &lt;strong&gt;desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Tim 2:4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; Then he went on to describe this liberating truth:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Tim 2:5 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:6 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.Notice, there is only one Mediator, which means that Jesus is the One we go to for access to the Father.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 14:6 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Gods ultimate design and goal for the body of Christ is that we &lt;strong&gt;may grow up into him in all things. &lt;/strong&gt;Gods design for KF is that we steadily and constantly be growing in grace and in the image and likeness of our Lord Jesus Christ. That is why we were redeemed. You see beloved, the Christian life is not about me, its not about you, its all about Jesus Christ and bringing Him glory.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Verse 16 tells us that it is in union with the Risen that the whole body is fit together perfectly. We get our English word harmony from the Greek term translated fitted and knit together. Filled with and motivated by the love of Christ, each part of the body is called to use their gifts and talents to build up the other parts of the body grow for the glory of God. Believers are not given gifts for their own private benefit, or hide them because they are shy. Remember what Jesus said to the person that hid their talents in the earth. No matter how super spiritual a person seems to be, no one can grow to maturity in Christ if they choose to stay isolated from the rest of the body. That is one of the reasons why we are warned in Hebrews 10 about then danger of neglecting or forsaking fellowship with one another. According to 1 John, ministering to one another in love is proof of new birth. It is out of a love for Jesus Christ and a love for one another that we are called to use our gifts to serve, love and edify one another in The Lord. The most excellent gift in the body of Christ is love. The great commandments are to love God supremely and love one another. The fruit of the Spirit is love. The presence of Jesus will not remain in a church that is not serving one another in love. The presence of Jesus will not flow out of a person or congregation that is selfish and self-centered.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;Knowing what Christ has done for you, enables you to walk in a worthy way. Theology without practically and loving obedience is hypocrisy. In Christ we are called to put off the old man and put on the new man and walk in a way which honors the Lord. How is your walk? What do you need to put on or put off?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;futility, folly, emptiness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of their mind, 18. Having the understanding (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;both moral and mental&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;hardness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of their heart: 19. Who being past feeling (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;having lost all sensitivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) have given themselves over unto lasciviousness (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unbridled sensuality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), to work all uncleanness with greediness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/97818440"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright wp-image-1441 size-full" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviolahttps://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/rayviolawatchwhite.jpg" alt="rayviolawatchwhite" width="240" height="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Know this beloved, the church has not been redeemed by the precious blood of The Lamb Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Spirit of God in order that we might peacefully co-exist with sin or fit in with this fallen world system.

I believe that one of the reasons why the church as a whole is not being as effective as we should be is because we are either afraid or ashamed of the consequences of being holy, or different than the world.We need to be willing to be separate like Daniel and the 3 Hebrew children were in Babylon.
The word &lt;strong&gt;therefore &lt;/strong&gt;here is a connecting word. Having established what God has done for us and who we are in Christ, The Holy Spirit now proceeds to tell us how we are to walk with Christ in a fallen world.&lt;!--more--&gt;

We see in these Scriptures that the Christian man or woman has been redeemed by Christ to live differently than they did before they were saved. We cannot be salt and light if we are not living differently than we used to.No longer are we to be conformed to this fallen worlds image and values; the Holy Spirit is transforming us into the image of Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 3.17 Now the Lord is that Spirit:and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of Jesus Christ redeems us from a self-centered, self-seeking life of &lt;strong&gt;vanity&lt;/strong&gt; to a God centered, Spirit filled life of meaning and purpose.
When Paul speaks of fallen man being ignorant, this is a condition that stems from a &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt; that is born in Adam, hardened and alienated from the life of God. This is why we need a new heart and a new spirit that comes from God.

Listen to a description of unregenerate mans condition.Verse 17 says that unsaved man is walking in &lt;strong&gt;vanity&lt;/strong&gt;. Empty. Just like the conclusion arrived at in Ecclesiastes. A companion word for vanity is the word futility. Unsaved man is pursuing a love affair with the fallen worlds values and pleasures. Only Jesus Christ and the regenerating power of God can rescue us from the futility of living for and enjoying this present evil world.

&lt;strong&gt;Darkness - &lt;/strong&gt;there is within each and every one of us a deep darkness that swallows up our understanding, and keeps us from seeing the glory of the gospel or the excellency of Christ. This is true whether I am a college professor or a high school dropout. A brain surgeon or a drug dealer. Only Gods light and grace in Jesus Christ can deliver us from this power of darkness.

&lt;strong&gt;Past feeling&lt;/strong&gt; has the idea of one's skin becoming callous and no longer sensitive to pain. Until a person is born again, there is no conviction of sin. They call good evil, and evil good.

&lt;strong&gt;Blindness&lt;/strong&gt; can also be understood here as &lt;em&gt;hardening&lt;/em&gt;, and this ancient Greek word "&lt;em&gt;is used medically to denote the callus formed when a bone has been fractured and reset. Such a callus is even harder than the bone itself&lt;/em&gt;." (Wood) Apart from the regenerating power of God my heart is hardened against God. I am like a stone toward all that is holy and spiritual. It does not move me, attract me or delight me.

&lt;strong&gt;Licentiousness&lt;/strong&gt; is sin that flaunts itself, throwing off all restraint and having no sense of shame or fear.Until a person is born again, a licentious person will make his goal in life something other than God. It may be the unbridled gratification of his body in sex or drink or drugs or food. Or it may be the gratification of his ego with more refined intellectual and cultural pursuits. Anything but God, and everything apart from God is the idea behind the word licentiousness.

&lt;strong&gt;Uncleanness&lt;/strong&gt; is a broad word, mostly with reference to sexual impropriety. It speaks of moral impurity. James tells us that true religion keeps itself unspotted from this fallen worlds influences.

&lt;strong&gt;With greediness- &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, the motivating factor in life for the unsaved person is rooted in greed and selfishness. Its all about me. My feelings. My happiness. My dreams. My pleasures.

&lt;strong&gt;20. But ye have not so learned Christ; 21. If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: &lt;/strong&gt;

How does one escape the futility and greediness that I speak of this morning? It is by hearing the voice of Jesus and being taught by Him. &lt;strong&gt;Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The truth is in Jesus- &lt;/strong&gt;What truth did Jesus teach? Love one another, even as I have loved you.

There are two powerful motivators in the world today that move men. You are moved by one of the two motivators. Men are either motivated by love, or they are motivated by greed. The man apart from Christ is motivated by greed. More fame. More money. More material things. More recognition. More God forbidden pleasures and lusts. And you and I see the devastating results that greed has wrought in the world around us.
On the other hand, the man who is in Christ is motivated by love. What they do they do in the name of Christ, what they do they do for Jesus Christ, for the love of Christ constrains me. And thus, they are serving and giving and going the extra mile to bless others because they are motivated by love, whereas those that are motivated by greed are only interested in getting.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 23. And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24. And that ye put on the new and man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The phrases &lt;strong&gt;put off &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;put on&lt;/strong&gt; have the same idea of putting off or putting on a set of clothes. In other words, now that we have been redeemed out of the prison of sin and this fallen world system, it is time to put on the garments of &lt;strong&gt;righteousness and true holiness.&lt;/strong&gt; The idea is to "change into" a different kind of &lt;strong&gt;conduct&lt;/strong&gt;. The present tense used with each of these commands, indicates continual action. Meaning that that we are to be doing this continually.

To put off the old man is another way of saying dont look back on the old life. Jesus isn't merely a spiritual addition to our old way of thinking and living. Once you are in Christ, the old life dies and Jesus becomes our new life. &lt;strong&gt;You are now a new creature in Christ Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Know ye not that the old man was crucified with Christ, that the body of sin should not reign as king over you any longer&lt;/strong&gt;? Put off that old man that is corrupted because of his deceitful lusts. So the old person is the old bundle of attitudes and emotions and practices that I used to be. That's who I was before I was called out of darkness. Yes, there is the tension between the flesh and The Spirit when you put off the old man and put on the new man. When you become a Christian, you do not go from war to peace; you go from a battle that you could not win, to a battle that you cannot lose.

In verse 23 we see a very important ingredient to walking in newness of life. Being renewed in the spirit of your mind. Why do we need to renew our minds? Because by nature we are not spiritually minded. Our minds are worldly, carnal and corrupt, and when your mind worldly, carnal and corrupt, you can even love to drink poison.

Paul wrote to the Romans, &lt;strong&gt;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world:but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&lt;/strong&gt;
To walk in newness of mind means that we are to be a &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 1.1-3&lt;/strong&gt; kind of a person.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. Wherefore putting away (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lay aside; strip yourself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The old man was accustomed to lying its way in and out of situations. That all changes in Christ. The new man tells the truth. The motive for doing this is because we are &lt;strong&gt;members of one another&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore there is no place for lying.Your physical body can only function properly if it tells itself the truth. If your hand touches something hot but your hand tells your brain that the thing is cool, your hand will be severely burned. That's why telling the truth is so important, because &lt;strong&gt;we are members of one another&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not the week, not the decade, but todays sun!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;don't go to sleep at night holding a grudge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) go down upon your wrath: 27. Neither give place to the devil (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;leave no such foothold for the enemy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Commentator John Trapp wrote: &lt;em&gt;He that will be angry and not sin, let him be angry at nothing but sin.&lt;/em&gt;There is a place for righteous anger in the Christian life. Jesus displayed that when He turned over the tables of the money changers in the temple.Would you please note that when you allow anger to brew and stew in your heart and mind, you are opening the door for the devil to come in and steal, kill, destroy and devour you and those around you.Brothers and sisters in Christ, when we harbor anger in our heart towards others, we are on the devils payroll and are actually doing the devil's work for him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The new man does not &lt;strong&gt;steal&lt;/strong&gt;, but he works &lt;strong&gt;with his hands&lt;/strong&gt;. He does this not only to provide for his own needs, but also to &lt;strong&gt;have something to give him who has need&lt;/strong&gt;.In other words, the kingdom purpose for working is not to build up my own kingdom on earth, but that we should work so that we can give. The purpose for getting is not to build a bigger and better kingdom of barns here on earth, but to invest into heavenly things by giving unto others for the glory of God.

You see beloved, it is not Christian just to stop stealing. It is not Christian just to work honestly in order to have things. It is Christian to work to have in order to giveto meet needs. All our work is to be a display of giving grace of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29. Let no corrupt (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unwholesome, foul, rotten&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. 30. And grieve not (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;vex, offend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31. Let all bitterness, and wrath (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;rage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;slander&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), be put away from you, with all malice (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ill will, spite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bitterness- &lt;/strong&gt;the resentful spirit that refuses reconciliation.
&lt;strong&gt;Wrath- &lt;/strong&gt;sudden outbursts of anger due to personal displeasure.
&lt;strong&gt;Anger&lt;/strong&gt;- this is a settled disposition. Some of the angriest people have the faces of angels, quiet voices, but the tongues of serpents.
&lt;strong&gt;Clamour- &lt;/strong&gt;loud expressions of grief and shouting.
&lt;strong&gt;Evil speaking- &lt;/strong&gt;blasphemy; slander.
&lt;strong&gt;Malice-&lt;/strong&gt; an evil or wicked disposition.

I grieve the Holy Spirit when filthy communication is in my heart or comes out of my mouth, for He is pure. He is holy. I grieve the Holy Spirit when I speak to someone in anger. I grieve the Spirit of God when I slander others. I grieve the Spirit of God when I use the Name of Jesus flippantly or carelessly. I grieve the Spirit of God when I hold a deep brewing, malicious attitude in my heart towards someone. I grieve The Spirit of God when I criticize and put someone down instead of making the effort to build him or her up in love. How many of you know that it is much easier to criticize than edify?

&lt;em&gt;A Christian is a person whose rotten root within has been made new by grace through faith in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. The grace of God has taken the hate and anger and resentment that spill over in mean and vulgar and irreverent language, and has covered them with the blood of Christ and killed them along with the old unbelieving self.&lt;/em&gt;

When it comes to the language of the child of God, the question is not that I am not using vulgarity like I used to. There are unsaved, moral people who refrain from swearing. The question is this: Am I building the faith of others by what I say? Is my mouth a means of grace? Or is my mouth the proverbial corrupt spring spoken of in &lt;strong&gt;James 3&lt;/strong&gt;?

What is the &lt;strong&gt;day of redemption&lt;/strong&gt; beloved? It is the day when the long battle with sin will be over. No more groaning with imperfection; no more waiting; no more frustrated longings. It is the day when the deepest longings of our heart will be satisfied with the sight of the glory of the grace of God in the face of Jesus. Our redemption will be complete.

Having learned what grieves The Spirit of God and damages relationships. Let us now see what bless The Spirit of God and strengthens relationships.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;readily and freely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 12.10 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 13.4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charity suffereth long, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is kind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3.8 Finally, &lt;em&gt;be ye&lt;/em&gt; all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; pitiful, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; courteous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Forgiving- &lt;/strong&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 18&lt;/strong&gt;, Jesus taught us that we are to forgive others the way God has forgiven us. Forgiveness of others is not a matter of mathematics. Forgiveness of others is not a matter of emotion or feelings. Forgiveness of others is a mater of Lordship and obedience.God's forgiveness is real and ours should be too. When God forgives, we are really restored. Nothing is held over our heads for later blackmail. It is gone: &lt;strong&gt;"As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us" (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Psalm%20103.12"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 103:12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; And so we fall short of our divine pattern if we forgive a wrong but secretly plan to keep it in the back of our minds for a later touch. When we forgive, let us really forgive one another, as God in Christ forgave us. To not forgive is tormenting and to some extent, the person you refuse to forgive is holding you spiritually hostage.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 John 2.12 I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His name's sake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Just as the altars of old testament had two flesh hooks to keep the sacrifice from slipping off, we have two hooks that keep us abiding in Christ--discipline and devotion. Are you disciplining yourself and devoting yourself as a living sacrifice to the glory of God?

The Gospel sets you free.

Jesus said, &lt;strong&gt;"The hour is coming, AND NOW IS, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%205.25"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 5:25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

This is a description of the person who is no longer alienated from the life of God. Jesus Christ has spoken in the truth of his Word. He has diagnosed our disease, and now He gives Himself as a cure and as a teacher to everyone who hears His voice and becomes His disciple.A person who is living apart from the life of Christ is living a life of frustration, and futility because like the woman at the well, all of their hopes, dreams and pleasures are wrapped up and bound to this world and this life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 4.13,14 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel is not a message that makes bad people good. It is a message that gives dead people life. I invite you to come to Jesus and drink the water of life freely.

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #71767a"&gt;A real man is not a self-centered or self-absorbed. A real man is a godly man, a man who is self-sacrificing and others centered. He will be a man of prayer and the word of God. This man will serve his family with Christ-like love and joyful obedience as an example of Jesus. This real man will go against the grain of this world....he will fight the good fight of faith..are you that man?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/98267405"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSALM 112.1 Praise ye The Lord. Blessed (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;happy, fortunate, to be envied&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) is the man that feareth (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reveres and worships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) The Lord, that delighteth greatly in His commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 CORINTHIANS 16.13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 TIMOTHY 6.11,12 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Because I am going to be covering the biblical order for the home and the biblical roles of the husband and wife in a Christian marriage from Ephesians 5 in a few weeks, I have decided this morning to make an appeal to all the men reading this blogto make a firm resolution to take a stand for Jesus by being a no-nonsense, God fearing, Christ loving, Spirit filled man, be it as a husband, father or single man for the glory of God.

So while this message may indeed be more directed towards married men and fathers, I appeal to every man to hear what The Spirit is saying to them.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Just like an egg can be fried, scrambled, boiled or poached, I am going to be serving the same things regarding being a Christ-loving husband and father over and over; but I pray that God would take these truths and write them with His finger upon each and every heart of each and every man today.

Last week I mentioned that there are 2 spirits shaping the course of mankind today. One is the spirit of this world. The other is The Spirit of the Living God. The one spirit is molding you into a man of the world. The Holy Spirit is molding you into the image of Jesus Christ. These two spirits are as opposite to each other as day and night. The one is antichrist and self-centered; the other is Jesus Christ and God-centered, plain and simple. You cannot be a man of the world and a man of God at the same time, any more than you can have twomasters.

Men, one of those two spirits, either the spirit of the world or the Spirit of God is shaping your ideas behind what it means to be a husband or a father.
I will say this again in a moment, but let me say here and now that I believe that The Scriptures alone provide us the picture of what it means to be a Christ-exalting, God-fearing husband and father.The picture that we are given in Scripture of what it means to be a godly husband is found in the example of how Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her. The main purpose of being a husband is to reveal the redeeming love and kindness of Jesus Christ.

This consistent, Christ-like example of love and kindness will cause a woman to bloom and blossom in her role as a wife and mother, just like the love and kindness of Christ inspires you to bloom and blossom. The picture of what it means to be a godly father is found in example of the fatherhood of God and how He deals with His children. This Christ-like example of fatherhood will inspire your son and daughter to desire God and want to follow and please Him.

Did you ever see the Marine recruiting ad on television? The Marines are looking for a few good men? Fathers, men, young men, old men. The King of Kings Jesus Christ is looking for godly men, and in particular, men who will take their biblical role to glorify Him in the workplace, the home and in the church seriously.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Chronicles 16.9 For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wholeheartedly devoted to Him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) toward Him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What is a perfect heart? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It is not a sinless heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is a heart that is complete - &lt;em&gt;not divided&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is a heart that is wholehearted- &lt;em&gt;no rival affections&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is a heart that has one agenda in life, and that is to bring glory and honor to God in everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In other words, a perfect heart is a heart that filters every single aspect and decision of our lives through the lens of Gods purposes, plans and desires for me. Does this please God? Does this honor God? Does this reflect Jesus Christ? The daily prayer of the man whose heart is perfect towards God is that his heart and life would be in alignment with the plans and purposes of God.

Married men, today I admonish you in the gracious and wonderful Name of The Lord Jesus Christ to once again recognize your God-given role as head and leader of your home. I exhort you today to rise up and lead your family in the things of The Lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I admonish you to take the lead in molding your family and its priorities by The Spirit of God, and not by the spirit of this world. Mold your family around biblical, kingdom of God values, not worldly, temporal values.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Men, when you sit down and do your family planning, do you fill your family calendar around the perspective of seek ye first the kingdom of God? Or do you plan everything else first, and if there is room or time, fit in the things that are near and dear to the heart of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I say this to you my fellow brothers in Christ because the very foundations of biblical order of headship in the home and kingdom family values as they are so clearly laid out in the bible are being portrayed today as being archaic and do not fit into this liberal, secualr society that we live in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There is a lot that can be said of the tragic consequences of the women's lib movement. But one of the arguments for rethinking headship in the home and fathering is due to the fact that there have been countless abusive or absentee husbands and fathers. Of course there will always be the unfortunate and unacceptable examples of abusive or tyranical and insecure husbands and fathers; but that does not negate or change the biblical ideal set out for husbands and fathers as is set before us in the Word of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wives, you are not called by God to be the head of your home, your husband is. Dear wives, let me remind you once again that your role in the covenant of marriage is to be your husband's helpmeet, not his head.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Children are to line up under the guidelines of their parents, and in particular, the father, who is the God appointed head of the home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;According to Gods Word, the husband/father is the man of the house, the Head of the wife. He is the leader of the family. We are to lead our wives and children lovingly and passionately. We are to lead our wives and children decisively and in the power and wisdom of The Holy Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are to make sure that all that our families do is done for the glory and honor of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I trust that every wife, son and daughter here today realizes that even the best Christian man on earth falls far short of being the perfect father and husband. But you have the potential to make being a husband or a father a delight or a disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As Christian men, I believe all human fatherhood should be patterned on the divine fatherhood. The overarching guide for every father who professes to know The Lord Jesus Christ should be to live in such a way that his children can see what God the Father is like. They ought to see in their human father a reflectionalbeit imperfectof the heavenly Father in his strength and tenderness, in his wrath and mercy, in his exaltation and condescension, in his surpassing wisdom and patient guidance. The task of every human father is to be for his children an image the Father in heaven.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 103:13 Like as a father pitieth (&lt;em&gt;shows compassion to&lt;/em&gt;) his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
God created fatherhood in His own image. Men, good fathering points to God. It points children to God, it points wives to God, it points coworkers to God, it points fellow church members to God, it points relatives to God.The main purpose of fathering is to reveal the fatherhood of God. I believe that the greatest mission for every single Christian father is to unveil and model the example and truth of Jesus Christ to their children.In fact, one of the greatest commands in all of Scripture is the command for &lt;strong&gt;fathers&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to bring them up (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;train them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eph 6.4&lt;/strong&gt;
Fellow husbands and grandfathers, we cannot bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of The Lord if we ourselves are making it a priority in our lives to walk in the nurture and admonition of The Lord.

To be the kind of fathers and husbands who have an impact upon our homes, we need to be daily looking at the example of The Fatherhood of God. As fathers, I believe that we are to learn how to treat our children by seeing how God treats His children. To some extent, our children will grow up getting a picture of the Fatherhood of God by watching their fathers. We see this in the study of the kings of Israel and Judah. Fathers, your daughters to some degree will grow up learning about the kind of husband to look for by watching how you love and treat your wife, their mother.

Brothers, being a father and husband isa huge calling that will have an impact on future generations. It is not a calling that is to take a back seat to any career or hobby. Gentlemen, to a certain extent, God holds us &lt;em&gt;PRIMARILY &lt;/em&gt;responsible for the spiritual condition of our families. There are too many men in the body of Christ that are abdicating or ignoring their responsibilities as fathers and putting the brunt of providing and nurturing their children to their wives.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 5:8 says, But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Even though the context of that verse is referring to financial provision for the family, unfortunately, too many men, including professing Christian men, express their role as father &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; in terms of financial provider. The fact is men, our wives and children are not only looking for financial provision; they are looking for love, guidance, and a role model for what it means to be a man who is following Jesus Christ.Providing for your family means much more than simply putting bread on the table. It includes the provision of all the elements of a Christ-like home: teaching and modeling Gods Word in an atmosphere of love, grace, patience, loving discipline, understanding, and encouragement. This would also include modeling biblical values, priorities, and pursuits.

I believe that providing for our family includes driving into their hearts and minds by word and example that the real meaning in life is that we have an as unto The Lord mentality in every thing that we say and do. Dads, do not hide your light under a bushel. Fathers that openly and vocally bless The Lord should be typical in the church today, but I fear that they are rare. Fathers, husbands, please do not underestimate the power of your vocal and visible love for and devotion for Jesus Christ.

Dads and husbands, let your children and wife hear you openly bless The Lord. Let them hear you pray. Let them see you read your bible. Let them hear you witness of His greatness and power. Let them see you serve The Lord. Let them see you go to a prayer meeting or a midweek service even when you are bone tired after a difficult day at work. If you dont live and act like Christ has your heart (&lt;em&gt;howbeit it imperfect&lt;/em&gt;), why should your wife and children even consider giving them their hearts?

There are three basic and key ingredients of a successful father in the home: &lt;strong&gt;Leadership, Love and Loyalty.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership&lt;/strong&gt; in the family in spiritual and moral values which sets the course of the family for life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt; that is not only stated, but shown and passed on to the children will set the course of the family for life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt; that sets the stage for trust and builds relationships that are strong for the times of testing that are sure to come as the family matures. The investment of these three ingredients will yield their sweet fruit for years to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 20:7&lt;/strong&gt; states, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The Just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; One of the great joys of the ministry is to see men set a Godly example of Love, Loyalty and Leadership and watch their children follow their walk in integrity. One of the great heartaches of the ministry is to watch men make the fatal mistake of not applying these things and face the ruin that follows.

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 17:6&lt;/strong&gt; states, &lt;strong&gt;"Childrens children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers." &lt;/strong&gt;Here are some things that make a father the glory of his children.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him live by faith consistently.&lt;/strong&gt; Hebrews 11.6&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him serve The Lord with gladness persistently.&lt;/strong&gt; Psalm 100.2&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him treating his wife tenderly and lovingly.&lt;/strong&gt; Eph. 5:25,28-29; 1 Pet.3:7&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him conduct his affairs at home, in the church and in the world honestly.&lt;/strong&gt; 2 Cor.8:21; Rom. 13:13&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him worship God and diligently seek Him in prayer, in His Word fervently. &lt;/strong&gt;John 4:23-24&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him help others graciously. &lt;/strong&gt;Gal. 6:10; 1 Tim. 6:17-19&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They watch him love the LORD supremely. &lt;/strong&gt;John 14:21-24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To all fathers and grandfathers in our church family.listen to Psalm 78
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps 78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Parenting and grandparenting is meant to declare the wondrous works of God in such a way that our children and grandchildren learn to set their hope in God, not money, not fame, not religion.Parenting and grandparenting is meant to tell children to obey God and leave all of the consequences to Him.

The most blessed man on planet earth is the man that fears The Lord and walks in His ways. &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 128 Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in His ways..&lt;/strong&gt;men, yield to The Spirit of God, and not the spirit of this world.

This Fathers Day  as you think of your earthly father or the father of your children  I want you to think of the One who loves you more than any other father. Think of the One who tells us in His Word that we can call Him Daddy (&lt;a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?t=niv&amp;amp;q=ro+8:15-16"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). God Almighty loved you so much He sent His Only Begotten Son to die in your place (and thereby pay the required penalty for your sins), it order that you, by Gods grace, through faith in Jesus Christ might receive eternal life. Will you receive Him this morning as your Lord?

And what does He require of you in return? Jesus himself said the greatest commandment  the one thing God requires of us  is that we &lt;strong&gt;love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?t=niv&amp;amp;q=mt+22:37-46"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 22:37&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;5.1 Be ye therefore followers (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;imitators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of God (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;copy Him and follow His example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), as dear children;&lt;/strong&gt;

The Christian has no greater calling or purpose in life than that of imitating The Lord Jesus Christ.As believers, we are called to imitate the example of Christ in all of our conduct. We are to be like Him, not as slaves trying to earn a wage but as His dear &lt;strong&gt;children.&lt;/strong&gt;

The apostle Paul said &lt;strong&gt;follow me, as I follow Christ (1 Cor 11.1).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/98930315"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright wp-image-1441 size-full" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviolahttps://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/rayviolawatchwhite.jpg" alt="rayviolawatchwhite" width="240" height="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The apostle John said&lt;strong&gt;, He that saith he abideth in Him so ought himself also so to walk even as He walked (1 John 2.6).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.2 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.&lt;/strong&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;walk&lt;/strong&gt; of the believer is a call to imitate God. Because God is love (&lt;strong&gt;1 John 4:8&lt;/strong&gt;); therefore, walk in love (&lt;strong&gt;Eph. 5:12&lt;/strong&gt;). Because God is light (&lt;strong&gt;1 John 1:5&lt;/strong&gt;); therefore, walk as children of light (&lt;strong&gt;Eph. 5:314&lt;/strong&gt;). Because God is truth (&lt;strong&gt;1 John 5:6&lt;/strong&gt;); therefore, walk in wisdom (&lt;strong&gt;Eph. 5:1517&lt;/strong&gt;). Peter would say, because God is holy, be ye holy (&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1.15,16).&lt;/strong&gt;

This imitating God is a continuation of the thought of putting on the new man in Christ.The tense for the word walk is in the present imperative, so it commands a deliberate, habitual action. This walk is a step-by-step, hour by hour, day by day walk that is following the example of Jesus Christ.Two very important aspects of the way that Gods people are to walk or be imitators of God are in forgivenessof one another&lt;strong&gt; (4. 32) &lt;/strong&gt;and the other is in love for one another&lt;strong&gt; (5. 2). &lt;/strong&gt;The Lord Jesus Himself is the supreme example in His self- sacrificing love for and forgiveness of lost sinners.

Relationships within the church are to be marked by the love of God. Jesus spoke of that at His Last Supper&lt;strong&gt;. Love each other,&lt;/strong&gt; He told His disciples, &lt;strong&gt;as I have loved you (John 15:12).&lt;/strong&gt; This new commandment also contained a promise. &lt;strong&gt;All men will know that you are My disciples if you love one another (13:35). &lt;/strong&gt;This love that we are to imitate, (like the love that Jesus Christ demonstrated for us) is a verb. Like James 2 tells us, it is a love that is demonstrated by action.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Offering, sacrifice, sweet smelling savor- &lt;/strong&gt;An offering and a sacrifice always speaks of a &lt;strong&gt;cost!&lt;/strong&gt;The cross of The Lord Jesus Christ was the brazen altar where, He, The Lamb of God was offered as the burnt sacrifice. It is His sacrifice on the cross that takes away the sin of the world. Every sacrifice that was offered in the Old Testament by Gods command pointed to the once and for all sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This is most beautifully recorded in the book of Hebrews. The past tense does not suggest that Christ has &lt;em&gt;stopped&lt;/em&gt; loving us but only that, when He &lt;strong&gt;gave Himself up for us&lt;/strong&gt;, it was the supreme act of His love (see &lt;a href="https://www.esvbible.org/John+15.13/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 15:13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

A &lt;strong&gt;sweet-smelling savour&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the various offering that we read about in &lt;strong&gt;Leviticus 15&lt;/strong&gt;, wherein we see the burnt offering, meal offering, and the peace offeringall called sweet-smelling offerings because the sacrifice of a substitutionary animal upon the altar was offered to God, and the smoke from the altar was acceptable to Him. Their aroma was sweet to the Father.So, too, when you and I choose to follow Jesus example of forgiveness and sacrificial love, the scent is sweet to the Father. Beloved, whenever we lovingly share the gospel of Jesus Christ with the lost, we are demonstrating the love of God and this is pleasing unto Him.Likewise, whenever we in the churchexpress this sacrificial love towards one another in practical daily ways, the Father considers that to be a sweet smelling savor.These acts of love are expressions of worship that are well pleasing unto God.

Verses 3-5 record things that are unloving and unacceptable in the eyes of God. They are the very things that bring about the wrath of God.

Let me state very clearly here that verses 3-5 is not a list of kinds of people that God hates. They are a description of the habitual lifestyles of people who are not born again, no matter what they are taught or what they believe.

&lt;strong&gt;5.3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints (&lt;/strong&gt;i.e. &lt;em&gt;this means they are not to be spoken of with approval&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fitting, appropriate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): but rather giving of thanks. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fornication - &lt;/strong&gt;is a common and acceptable sin in the world today. The Greek word for fornication is any and every kind of sexual intimacy outside of the sacred covenant of marriage between a man and a woman.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncleanness - &lt;/strong&gt;all forms of immorality. In particular, this refers to anything that pollutes the heart and mind.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covetousness - &lt;/strong&gt;is a grasping desireand not just for money or material wealth. It may be a desire to be mentally superior to someone else. It could be coveting a home or a position. It is the violation of the tenthcommandment. Jesus said &lt;strong&gt;beware of covetousness, for a mans life consists not in the abundance of the things that he possesses. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filthiness - &lt;/strong&gt;unclean speech, often veiled in innuendo or double meaning. It is the kind of language that the canned audiences laugh about on Comedy Central or prime time television sitcoms. Anyone watching culture knows that what once caused people to blush is now nothing but a joke because our culture has become totally desensitized. Proverbs says, &lt;strong&gt;fools make a mock of sin. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foolish talking -&lt;/strong&gt; in context, foolish talking means to gloat or brag about sinning. Locker room talk.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesting - &lt;/strong&gt;does not mean good, clean humor. Jesting means to make light of sensuality and immorality. Light-hearted wickedness.It is the mentality that sin as described in the bible is archaic and really no big thing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving of thanks -&lt;/strong&gt; one way to avoid coveting others possessions is to concentrate with thanks upon the good things the Lord has given us. The bible says that with food or clothing, be content. The root cause of our giving of thanks is because our names are written in the Lambs Book of Life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5.5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoremonger - &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word translated whoremonger is &lt;em&gt;pornos&lt;/em&gt;, from which we get our word pornography. Whore-mongering is embracing a prostituted life. And that can happen on the 900 telephones lines, on the Internet, in the things you read, and in the movies you see.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covetous man who is an idolator - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A greedy person is an idolater because he puts things before God. &lt;/em&gt;Coveting does not simply mean to want something, it means to idolatrously want something; it means to inordinately want something. Coveting wants anything more than God. Coveting is saying that there is something besides God and His love and His salvation that I must have as a requirement for being happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Other lists of vices that imperil inheritance in the kingdom are also found in&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 6.9,10 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 21.8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 22.15 For without &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No inheritance in the kingdom of God and of Christ - &lt;/strong&gt;people who habitually live in disobedient sin without repentance thereby prove themselves to be unconverted and the sons of disobedience (&lt;strong&gt;Eph 2.2&lt;/strong&gt;) regardless of what their profession of faith is. Paul is not talking about the battle between the flesh and the spirit struggle that every saved person has. He is talking about the person whose lifestyle is the habitual embracing of ones flesh. If you cater to your flesh day after week after month after year after decade, you need to take a careful look at your spiritual stand.

&lt;strong&gt;5.6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. &lt;/strong&gt;

There were false teachers who were preaching a gospel of grace without the need for repentance or hominess.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jude 4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;changing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Dare are we make light of that which brings down the wrath of God?Filthy lusts must be rooted out. These sins must be dreaded and detested. &lt;em&gt;No Christian will be sinless in this present life, but it is dangerously deceptive for Christians to offer assurance of salvation to a professing believer whose life is characterized by persistent sin and who shows no shame for that sin or hunger for the holy and pure things of God. &lt;/em&gt;John MacArthur

What does the message of the gospel of the grace of God teach us?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Titus 2.11-15 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of grace is really a life of repentance and faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. If you believe what you like about the gospel of the grace of God, but reject what you don't like or agree with about the gospel, it isnt the gospel you believe, but yourself. The warning is real. Gods wrath is coming for those who practice these things, whose identity is found in them. But it need not be your story. Paul said to the Corinthians under similar circumstances, &lt;strong&gt;And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God (1 Cor. 6:11).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.&lt;/strong&gt;

The command of God to the children of light is to remove the darkness, not to share in it. Even the appearance of it is to be abstained from.Paul is not telling Christians to avoid all contact with nonbelievers but to avoid joining with them in their sin. The unsaved world is our mission field. Where you live is your mission field. Where you work is your mission field. Where you play sports, which is your mission field.

&lt;strong&gt;5.8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul reminds the believers of their former state prior to conversion. They were not just in darkness, they were darkness; living in ignorance and sin.&lt;strong&gt;Now are ye light in The Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 4.16 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 2.9 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But ye &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of Jesus Christ is a real, transforming power that delivers those who believe it out of the kingdom and power of darkness.

&lt;strong&gt;Walk as children of light- &lt;/strong&gt;You will remember that&lt;strong&gt; 1 John 1:7 &lt;/strong&gt;speaks of walking in the light as He is in the light. Light is visible, isnt it? That light fixture up there is simply being what it was created to be. It is not striving to be a light fixture. It is not trying to be relevant to its surroundings. It is simply being a light!

&lt;strong&gt;5.9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Light &lt;/strong&gt;produces good fruit of goodness, righteousness and truth.

&lt;strong&gt;5.10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. &lt;/strong&gt;

Pauls instruction is plain and direct: Christians are to faithfully live in righteousness and purity and have nothing at all to do with the evil ways and works of Satan and the world. The two ways of living are unalterably opposed to each other and mutually exclusive.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 6.14 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The unfruitful works of darkness&lt;/strong&gt; are not to be ignored among Gods holy people. They are to be &lt;strong&gt;reproved (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;exposed; found fault with; corrected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;in light of Gods holy truth.Our mission and presence in the world is to be holy as our Lord is holy and ambassadors of Christ by being salt and light in a world of darkness and deceit.

&lt;strong&gt;5.12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. &lt;/strong&gt;

The body of Christ should even be ashamed to speak of the things that unregenerate man is not ashamed to do.

&lt;strong&gt;5.13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 3.19-21 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5.14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.&lt;/strong&gt;

The source of this quotation is uncertain. Some believe it is a quote from &lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 60.1. &lt;/strong&gt;It may be a fragment of a Christian hymn.This is a call to convicted sinners to wake from death in sin to a sense of thy guilty, lost condition, and look to Jesus Christ Who died for thee, and He will make thee light, and thus sanctify and save thee.

Would you please note that the deadness of men in trespasses and sins does not disable or free them from obligation to awake and call upon Christ Who will enable them to walk in newness of life.Jesus said that he who lives in sin, is a slave to sin. Sin is a hard taskmaster. It is the mother of all addictions and sorrow. If that is you this morning, I have great news for you..
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 4.18-21 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. &lt;em&gt;And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on Him&lt;/em&gt;. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus invites you to come to Him todayand receive His forgiveness and a new heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 22.17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>Marriage in todays society and even in the church is in deep trouble. If there were a National Geographic Special on the topic of marriage, it could possible be called, The Biblical view of Marriage: an Endangered species.

Liberal theologians are seeking to redefine the Biblical meaning and roles of marriage based on the fallen mores of society, that are in direct opposition to Almighty God.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/100705270"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-1441 size-full" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviolahttps://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/rayviolawatchwhite.jpg" alt="rayviolawatchwhite" width="240" height="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Biblical marriage is a covenant, heterosexual relationship between one man and one woman who are individually walking in the fear of God. Biblical marriage is a covenant that is entered into with vows made with one another and most importantly before Almighty God. If we are to honor those vows, as Paul has already said, we need to be Spirit filled and be prepared to wage war against the lies of our culture, our fleshly lusts, our emotions, our speech, and our self centered attitudes.

A biblical, covenant marriage is one that is going to live under the submission to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. That means that the wife is going to submit to her husband, and the husband is going to love, nourish and cherish his wife.

The Biblical pattern that a Christian marriage is intended to resemble is the loving and gracious relationship that Jesus Christ has with His Bride, the Church. Also mark this upon your heart. The number one purpose for your marriage is not your personal happiness. Oh when two souls are sold out for Jesus, and walking in the love of Christ and serving one another, there will be joy and happiness indeed. But happiness in and of itself cannot be the goal. When personal happiness becomes the meaning of marriage, the next step is divorce, plain and simple.

What is the biblical purpose for a Christian marriage? It is the same as is the case of individual Christians. To bring glory to God. &lt;strong&gt;As for me and my house, we will serve The Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;The purpose of a Christian wife is to be a reflection of how the church submits to The Lord Jesus for the glory of God. The purpose for a Christian husband is to nourish, cherish and love his wife as Jesus loves His church for the glory of God.&lt;!--more--&gt;

When either the husband, or wife, ignores or simply stops submitting to their God ordained roles, the net results will be fault finding, frustration, aggravation, tension, lack of communication, and alienation. This is not Gods design or purpose for a Christian marriage. A Christian marriage isnt reform school, where each spouse is seeking to conform their husband or wife into their image and likeness. The goal of the Christian marriage is that both husband and wife be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ for the glory of God.

When husbands or wives dig in their proverbial heels and refuse to walk in their God given role in marriage, it matters not how smart or wise they think they are, they are asking for trouble, &lt;em&gt;because no wife or husband is smarter or wiser than God Himself&lt;/em&gt;! Disobedience quenches the Holy Spirit of God and cuts off the much-needed supply of &lt;strong&gt;love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control &lt;/strong&gt;that our marriage needs to grow and give glory unto God. &lt;strong&gt;(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gal 5:22-23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Let the ground of all religious actions be obedience; examine not why it is commanded, but observe it because it is commanded. True obedience neither procrastinates nor questions&lt;/em&gt;. QUARLES

All relational marital problems (&lt;em&gt;not such problems as deaths, illnesses, unavoidable financial setbacks, etc&lt;/em&gt;.) stem from disobedience by either the husband or wife, or both, to the one rule given to each spouse.A Sunday school teacher once asked her class, &lt;em&gt;'How is the will of God done in heaven?&lt;/em&gt; One child answered, '&lt;em&gt;Cheerfully&lt;/em&gt;. Another, &lt;em&gt;'By everybody&lt;/em&gt;. A third, &lt;em&gt;'All the time&lt;/em&gt;. But the best answer was, &lt;em&gt;'It is done without asking any questions&lt;/em&gt;.

A Christian Marriage is like banking or farming: If there is no deposit, there can be no withdrawal; if there is no sowing, there will be no reaping. A Christian marriage requires a mutual deposit of prayer, unselfishness (agape), communication, understanding, forgiveness, grace, and intimacy. If you are not sowing the seeds mentioned above on a daily basis, then you cannot expect to reap a harvest.

What kind of deposits are you making in your marriage? What kind of seeds are you sowing in your marriage?

If your marriage is on the rocks or in trouble today, it is because you are doing things your own way instead of Gods way. Gods ways work, but they require obedience, discipline and patience with one another.

A beautiful elderly couple was asked by their church to give their testimony of 65 years of marriage to one another. After the meeting, a few newly wed and other couples asked them how long they had been working on their message. They said for the last 65 years.

&lt;strong&gt;Henry Fords &lt;/strong&gt;gave great advice when asked on his &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;50th wedding anniversary &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;for his rule for marital bliss and longevity. He replied, Just the same as in the automobile business, &lt;strong&gt;stick to one model&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Martin Luther &lt;/strong&gt;described marriage, &lt;strong&gt;Let the wife &lt;/strong&gt;make the husband glad to come home, and &lt;strong&gt;let him &lt;/strong&gt;make her sorry to see him leave.

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5.22-24 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and He is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.&lt;/strong&gt;

Ladies, like a perfect gentleman, I begin our 2 part series on the roles in marriage with you. I want to keep this simple. I want you to write down on a 3 by 5 card &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5.22-24&lt;/strong&gt;. Submission to your husband is your God given role in your marriage for functional purposes. Do not focus on what your husbands role. Focus on yours, for only you can fulfill the role of the wife.

It must be understood that even though a husband and wife &lt;em&gt;in Christ&lt;/em&gt; are equal in the sight of God according to &lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/strong&gt;, divine authority and submission is necessary for the kind of functional order that glorifies God.

Equality of personhood does not negate the principle of submission to God ordained authority whether it be in the work place, in government, within the family, and in the marriage covenant.

Submission has nothing to do with personal value or worth. According to &lt;strong&gt;James 3.9&lt;/strong&gt;, every single human being is made in the image of God. It has everything to do with order and functionality. And the only time that this principle of submission is to be disobeyed is when the person in authority demands that you flat out disobey God. Then the principle found in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 5:29&lt;/strong&gt;overrules it: &lt;strong&gt;We ought to obey God rather than men&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, no human being in a position of authority has the authority to demand disobedience to the Word or will of God. Sapphira died by submitting to her husbands lie about the price of land he sold (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 5:1-10&lt;/strong&gt;).

This principle of equality and submission is given to us in the Godhead.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 11:3&lt;/strong&gt; Paul says, "&lt;strong&gt;But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You may ask, "What does that mean God is the head over Christ? I thought they were one."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The answer is yes and no, Jesus said, "&lt;strong&gt;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:9&lt;/strong&gt;), and, "&lt;strong&gt;I and the Father are one" (John 10:30&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 1&lt;/strong&gt; says that Christ was exalted to be equal with God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So what does it mean that God The Father is the head of Christ? God's headship over Christ is a not matter of essence; it is a matter of function. Within the function of the Godhead, it was deemed necessary that Christ submit Himself.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The same Jesus who said, &lt;strong&gt;"All authority is given unto Me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:18)&lt;/strong&gt; also said, &lt;strong&gt;"My food is to do the will of Him that sent Me" (John 4:34).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In essence and nature, Christ and The Father are the same; but by God's design, the function of the Son demanded that He submit to The Father in a beautiful act of humiliation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil 2.5-8 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The same principle of submission is true in marriage. The essence, the spiritual quality, and the position before God of both husband and wife are the same; but in the family, for the sake of function, the woman is to take the place of submission to the leadership of man.

Equality before God does not negate the principle of authority and submission.It's not a matter of who's better---it's a matter of Gods design for order and functionality.

Let me repeat this very important truth again: The goal of submission is to please and glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. The very act of submission to Him, by either husband or wife, is an act of worship! Marriage is not a power struggle or a gender war. It is a husband and wife mutually &lt;strong&gt;submitting to one another in the fear of God&lt;/strong&gt;. (v 21) The husband who is walking in the fear of God is to love the wife unconditionally; the wife who is walking in the fear of God is to submit to the husband unconditionally  unless that submission demands sinful behavior. Plain and simple.

In a parallel passage to &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5:22,&lt;/strong&gt; Paul said, &lt;strong&gt;Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord&lt;/strong&gt; (Col. 3:18).

Aneko (to be fitting) was sometimes used of that which was legally binding, as in Philemon 8, where Paul uses it in reference to legal propriety. The word refers to that which is the accepted standard of human society.

Eve was created from Adams rib and ordained to be his companion, to be, as Adam himself beautifully testified, &lt;strong&gt;bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh (Gen. 2:2223)&lt;/strong&gt;.

Gods curse did not change His basic plan for mutuality in the marriage relationship or for the functional authority of the husband over the wife.

Man was created first and was created generally to be physically, constitutionally, and emotionally stronger than woman, who is &lt;strong&gt;a weaker vessel (1 Pet. 3:7).&lt;/strong&gt;

Both before and after the Fall and the consequent curse, man was called to be the provider, protector, guide, and shepherd of the family, and woman called to be supportive and submissive.

Lets look again at this word submit. It means, &lt;em&gt;to willingly rank underneath or to relinquish ones rights to anothers authority&lt;/em&gt;. The words &lt;strong&gt;submit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;helper&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Gen 2:18&lt;/strong&gt;) put together means that the wifes role is to voluntarily surrender to Jesus, and in doing so yield to her husband in order that she may complete his incompleteness.

Also, submit is a military term. But again, that does not mean that the wife is inferior and the husband superior. This role of submission is for functional purposes. Some commentators have pointed out that the earliest manuscripts do not even contain the word submit that we have here in Ephesians 5.22, and that is true. But they do this to try to wiggle around the obvious command given by God to wives, &lt;strong&gt;submit to your own husbands in The Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

If you read ahead in Ephesians, you will see that the principle of submission and authority is covered from 5.22-6.9. You will notice that in 6.1, children are to obey their parents in The Lord and in 6.5, servants are to obey their masters in The Lord.

I personally believe that the reason why the word submit is given to wives instead of obey here is so that husbands will see that they are not to treat their wives like they are children, nor are we to treat them as if they were our slaves.

Also, just as the husband is not to treat his wife like a child or a slave (but as his helper and companion), the wife is not to treat her husband like he is her child. He already has a mother, and hes not married to her!

Older Christian wives and mothers are to teach the younger women and wives&lt;strong&gt; Titus 2.5 &lt;em&gt;To be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word that is translated obey here means to be in subjection to; to line up under.

Wives, why are you called to obey your own husband? Is it because Jesus loves husbands more than wives? Because husbands are always smarter than wives and are flawless in their decision making processes&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;The reason given is because when a Christian woman is usurping the authority of the man in the home, the divine design and order for a marriage is being violated.

Now I am sure that if I were a woman, right about now I would probably be thinking how can I possibly get that microphone cord around Pastor Rays skinny little neck and squeeze it as tightly as possible. I am going to tell you from the bible why you feel that way. It is the one thing that changed in the dynamics of the husband/wife relationship after the fall.

Back In &lt;strong&gt;Gen 3:16, &lt;/strong&gt;God said to the woman, &lt;strong&gt;I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you&lt;/strong&gt;.

Ladies, is it true that having children is painful? It is equally true that the husband is the functional head of the family. However, here is your challenge.
This same word for &lt;strong&gt;desire&lt;/strong&gt; is used in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;amp;c=4&amp;amp;v=7%23s=4007"&gt;Genesis 4:7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt; of sin to master over Cain. Because of the curse, Eve would have to fight a desire to master her husband, a desire that works against God's ordained order for the home.

The principle of Adam's headship as a husband was established before the fall (see &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=18#s=2018"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 2:18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=22#s=2022"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Now the curse on Eve makes it much harder for her to submit and flow with God's institution of male headship in the home.

This is even more difficult in a marriage where the wife is saved but the husband isnt. Ironically, we read in &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3.1-6 &lt;/strong&gt;that Gods principle of headship doesnt change. Again, the only exception is when a husband is asking you to do something that is clearly sinful or illegal.

A word to all single Christian sisters here this morning. Especially those whose marital time clock is ticking away. I sincerely beseech you to be prayerful and careful about whom you marry. Get to know him well enough to show his true colors. Most men act real good in church or around other Christians while they are in pursuit of a wife.

Ask (and honestly answer) yourself these questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does he love Jesus Christ more than you?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does he honor his relationship with Jesus Christ by keeping himself sexually pure?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does he inspire you to walk closer to Jesus?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is he a man of prayer and does he pray with you?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does his life reflect submission to Gods Word?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is he lazy or is he a hard worker? Does he work at all?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If not, why not?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If he doesnt work, what does he do with his time?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would you have to support him?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is he punctual and a wise steward of his finances?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does his yes mean yes and his no mean no?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is he kind, tenderhearted, understanding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If he was previously married, it would be wise to get all of the information that you possible can about why that relationship ended up the way that it did. He is apt to only tell you his side of the story. A Chrits-loving, God-fearing man will not be bothered by any of the questions that I have just put before you.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;1 Peter 1.24,25 For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;I was looking at turn of the century and mid1900 photos of people and places in the village of East Rochester the other night. As I looked at photos of the town, and in particular, of our church building, my thoughts began to reflect on Y2K. Remember that? People were scrambling to "prepare" for the big breakdown of technology as we know it. I remember being in India about a year before Y2K was to happen. I remember talking with a few brothers in Christ about Y2K as we were walking through a village in rural India. I asked them the question, "If Y2K were to happen, how much would it effect the church in this village?" The answer? Not at all.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;So, as I was rummaging through those old ER photos on my IPad, I asked myself these questions. What technology did the church in ER have at the turn of the century? Almost nothing. No Internet. No Facebook. No Twitter. No cell phones or IPads. I then wondered what their church services would have been like back then? Probably hymnals instead of overheads for lyrics. Now please do not misunderstand me, I am not anti technology or modern amenities. My question is this. Do we need more than that rural church in India or the church in ER had at the turn of the century to have church? Could we do church if there was a "brown out" of technology? Could we survive or communicate with one another without cell phones or IPads? Could we exist as a non-electric church? Acoustic singing. No PA systems.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;What did the church have back in the book of Acts that we have today? The Scriptures. The same Gospel. Fellowship with The Father and His Son. The indwelling Holy Spirit and His gifts and power. Prayer. The promise of His soon return to inspire them to deny themselves, pick up their crosses and follow Jesus with a reckless abandon. Is that enough for us today? Would a Y2K shut down our church, your church. If so, do we have one at all? Far fetched you say? Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? Luke 18.8. Selah.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Ephesians 6:10-24</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;We conclude our study of Ephesians with an exhortation regarding the reality of spiritual warfare and the need to put on the whole armor of God. The Christian life is anything but passive. We see analogies of it being likened to a race, a wrestling match and a fight of faith. To put it bluntly beloved, a daily part of the Christian life is a war against principalities and powers of darkness.&lt;/em&gt;

In chapters 1-3 we have talked about being seated in heavenly places in Christ. That is our position in Christ.In chapters 4-6.9, we have talked about walking with The Lord in the power of The Holy Spirit and how that plays out in all of our relationships within the church, the home, the world, and the workplace.Once again take note of the fact that God does not tell us how to live for Him until He first tells us what He has done for us. The Christian life is a yielded life that responds to the grace and love of Jesus Christ.

Now before Paul bids his farewell, and makes a few closing comments, he closes with a much needed exhortation regarding spiritual warfare and the need to stand against the wiles of the devil by putting on the whole armor of God.

When you hear the words spiritual warfare and the armor of God what picture do you form in your mind?This one?

&lt;a href="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/Slide1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1559" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviola/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide1-1024x768.jpg" alt="Slide1" width="620" height="465" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Casual, no real threat, what war? Who needs armor on a day like today?
OR this one?

&lt;a href="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/Slide2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1560" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviola/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Slide2" width="620" height="465" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Intense, a real enemy with real weapons and a real intention to take your life? a need to constantly be on guard against his attacks because casualties are suffered if we are not properly clothed.

Honestly saints, the reason for picking the first image was to make the point that spiritual warfare IS NO JOKE.By grace through faith in Jesus Christ, we have peace with God, but we do not have peace with the world, the flesh or the devil, thus, we need Gods Armor.Yes, we have already learned in chapter 1 that we are completely forgiven and secure in Christ. But, until we get to heaven, there is going to be an ongoing battle with the world, the flesh and our adversary, the devil.

Jesus told Peter, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat. I believe that is the devil's agenda for each and every one of us who are in Christ Jesus.Every aspect of your life is subject to the attack of the enemy. Your marriage, the raising of your children, your vocation, your finances, your area of ministry and service unto The Lord. In each and every one of these areas of life, the enemys agenda is to steal, kill, destroy, devour and divide the people of God.The same holds true for the body of Christ and our church family as well. The devil seeks to destroy and devour any and every ministry here. The devil seeks to destroy and devour personal relationships here.

Beloved, spiritual warfare is an every day part of the normal Christian life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;James 4.7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 5.8,9 Be sober (self controlled), be vigilant (alert); because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might (not in yourselves but in the Lord and in the in the power of his boundless resource).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Because this is a spiritual battle, we need divine resources to fight.Note that all of this instruction for spiritual warfare begins with the reminder to be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. We do not win any battle against evil in our own strength, but only with the spiritual resources provided by our Savior.This power of God is for all of Gods people. Old, young, married, single, baby Christian or mature Christian. It has nothing to do with your IQ. It has nothing to do with your physical condition. It has nothing to do with your income level. It has nothing to do with where you live: in the city or the suburbs, in a trailer, an apartment or a house. It has nothing to do with your marital status.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Put on the whole (or full) armor of God- Lord willing, we will see that each piece has been specifically designed to cover and protect a vital part of our being.
Wileshere meansstrategies and tricks. This Greek word carries the idea of cleverness, crafty methods, cunning, and deception. Beloved, never underestimate the deceptive power of the devil.

Truth be told beloved, God has already served us notice of the devil schemes. He tells us not be ignorant of his devices (2 Cor 2.11). Thus dear ones, the devil cannot succeed in destroying or devouring you or us or any ministry or relationship within this flock apart from us believing and acting upon his lies instead of believing Gods Word and walking on Gods truth in spite of how I feel or what I think.

What do I/we need to do to stand against the wiles of the enemy? The recognition that such a battle exists and is going on at this very moment. A soldier mentality for the battle: in The Lords army, there are no civilians; we are all called to be soldiers.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Timothy 2.3,4 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A desire to be disciplined in order to subject myself to God and His will in order to win the race:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Cor 9.24-27 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesians 6.12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood (any physical enemy; we are not wrestling against people made of flesh and blood), but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Wrestle - A military term used to describe hand to hand combat. We are told to fight the good fight of faith.Whenever there is a conflict in your life with another person, remember this verse. Paul is saying that it is not people (flesh and blood) that we are fighting against. Beloved, your enemy is neither your brother in church who offended you, nor your relatives or your neighbor, but Satan and his spiritual forces who have already been defeated by Jesus but refuse to accept that defeat.

Now if you roll your eyes and say, that is crazy Pastor Ray, the enemy already has snared you into his web of deceit and defeat. The proper name devil literally means, slanderer. Satan is the Accuser of the brethren. He is the Tempter. He is the king of pride and self-exaltation.Whenever a conflict arises, the devil wants us to get our eyes off of Jesus and His sacrifice for us. Thus, whenever our eyes are off The Lord and how He taught us to treat those who hurt us or attack us, we instinctively feed thoughts of revenge, anger, and bitterness. We refuse to forgive as God in Christ has forgiven us. As it says in Proverbs 13, our pride feeds the contention, instead of seeking ways for reconciliation and healing.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour ofGod (every piece of God), that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In his description of the Whole Armor of God, Paul combines the weapons of a Roman foot soldier with a number of Old Testament images of God, or the Messiah, as a warrior. The imagery comes from the book of Isaiah, where the Lord and his Messiah are arrayed for battle (Isa. 11:45; 52:7; 59:17). In other words, the way to combat temptation is the way Jesus did. The way to deal with those who hurt us, persecute us, despitefully use us, is the way Jesus did.

Every piece of the armor has a positional meaning and a practical meaning. We need to know who we are in Christ if we are to walk in the victory of Christ. We are not fighting for victory. We are fighting from a position of victory.Brothers and sisters, if we are going to stand against the fiery darts of the devil, we need to have on every piece of Gods armor. If we do not have on the whole armor of God, we are going to suffer for it.Imagine a soldier landing at Normandy or fighting in the trenches of Afghanistan with no armor on. What if they only had on a helmet? What if they did not have a gun or hand grenades? What if they had on flip flops instead of combat boots?

Evil day-Since the fall of man, every day has been evil, a condition that will persist until the Lord returns and establishes his own righteous kingdom on earth. Jesus said, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Stand- Gods will for each is that we stand against the wiles of the enemy. When you read the word stand, do not think of standing in line at WalMart. or standing in line wit your ticket to enter the ballpark. or even a soldier standing at ease. To stand means that we are to hold our ground, continue in the station in which you are placed, keep your post, be upon your watch, and be on guard. To be found standing at the end of a battle in those days meant that you won. But we only can stand if we know who we are in Christ and if we put on the whole armor of God. God provides the armor, and we must put it on.

Loins gird about with truth- The Roman soldiers leather belt supported and protected his lower abdomen, gathered his tunic together, and held his sword. The belt that pulls all the spiritual loose ends in is truth. The truth of Who Jesus is in a world of false Jesus. The truth of the gospel of salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, for the glory of God alone in a world where people are seeking to earn or work their way to heaven by their good deeds or religious rituals. The truth of Gods Word in a world of lies and deception.

We are to put on truth because the enemy traffics in lies and deception. Lies disguised as temptationlies in the name of science. The Lie of evolution. Evolutionists tell us that if we had the time to stand in front of a cage of chimps, over a period of time we would see those chimps gradually change into a man in a business suit carrying an IPad and talking on a smart phone. After God created Adam, he created the chimps!

Breastplate of righteousness- The breastplate was usually a tough, sleeveless piece of leather or heavy material with animal horn or hoof pieces sewn on, covering the soldiers full torso, protecting his heart and other vital organs. The most vital organ that we have is our heart. When the Bible speaks of the heart, it is referring to the real you, the inner man. Our heart is your will and your affections. Jesus said that out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies.

But when you come to Christ, He gives you a new heart. Thus, Satan is always seeking to draw us into the arena of the old man and the flesh, because when he gets us there, we are mincemeat. That is why it is important for us to know that we are the righteousness of God in Christ.Believers are protected by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them (Ro 4:6- 11; Php 3:9), and it is by faith in His righteousness that we walk in righteousness (Rom 6-8) and can stand up to the temptations and accusations of the devil.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Feet shod/gospel of peace- The image here is of the Roman soldiers sturdy sandals, which gave him stability and protection in battle. Some historians credit footwear as one of the greatest reasons why the Roman Army was so victorious over its enemies. The Roman Soldier was equipped with footwear that had spikes on the soles that provided them a strong enough stance and balance that gave them a superior posture in battle on hills and uneven terrain.

For those of you who take karate or martial arts, you know that the stance is the most important move and is what is practiced first, for from the basic stance are all manners of kicks and punches launched!Ironically, the peace that comes from the gospel readies one for war against evil (Eph 2:14, Eph 2:15, Eph 2:17). It is a peace in he midst of the battle, apart from it.

The gospel of peace pertains to the good news that, through Christ, believers are at peace with God and he is on their side (Rom. 5:610). It is that confidence of divine support that allows the believer to stand firm, knowing that since he is at peace with God, God is his strength.But it also means that you and I will be peacemakers, not troublemakers, not instigators. We will not be self-appointed spiritual police or sin sniffers. We will not be walking time bombs, ripping into or attacking this person or that person (remember, our primary battle is not with flesh and blood). The child of God is a bearer of peace, not a sower of discord and contention. The fruit of the Spirit is peace (not tension, not contention, not slander or gossip).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isa 52.7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Shield of faith- The faith that is spoken of here is a life that places a firm trust in the character and promises of God. Without faith, it is impossible to please God.The Roman shield was large enough to cover the whole body; it was made of wood, covered with hide, and bound with iron at the top and bottom. When dipped in water before a battle, it could extinguish fire arrows that had been dipped in pitch and set ablaze.

It has also been noted that when an army was under enemy attack, they would link their shields together side by side and over their heads to form an almost impenetrable shield. Since the unity in The Spirit in the bond of peace is vital for this warfare. We can see why the enemy is constantly seeking to divide and devour relationships within the body of Christ.

I would only add here that the first mention of the word shield in Scripture is found in the book of Genesis.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gen 15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. I will protect you, I will strengthen you, and I will be your shield. The shield of faith is not something it is Someone!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Fiery darts- Peter writes about the fiery trials of our faith. Temptations and trials are likened to the flaming arrows that were shot by the enemy with the goal being to cripple you, disable you or kill you. Some of the most common fiery darts of the enemy are condemnation, pride, hardness of heart, self-pity, the prosperity and good life of the unsaved, persecution, discouragement, false accusations, ill health, unexpected turn of events, lack of forgiveness, envy, mental assumptions about others, preoccupation with worldly attractions and distractions.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Helmet of salvation- The helmet protected the head, always a major target in battle. A well-designed helmet will protect you from various angles of attack. Remember what is in your helmet, your head and in your head is your mind. The helmet guards our mind and thoughts. Daily keep your mind filled with the gospel of Jesus Christ and renewed with The Word of God.

Satan is constantly seeking to destroy a believers assurance of salvation and the truth of what it means to walk with Jesus in newness of life with his weapons of temptation, doubt and discouragement. He is seeking to get us to lean upon our own understanding and reason.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Cor 10.3-5 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Sword of The Spirit- The one offensive weapon in the believers arsenal is compared to the Roman sword, short and designed for hand- to- hand combat. Gods word is the only needed weapon. Gods Word is infinitely more powerful than any of Satans attacks, and offensively to help destroy the enemys strategies.See Jesus use of Scripture in Mt 4:1- 11; Lk 4:1- 13
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/Slide10.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1561" src="https://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviola/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Slide10-1024x768.jpg" alt="Slide10" width="620" height="465" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
In verses 18-20, the cap to the armor of God ends with an urgent call to militant prayer on behalf of all believers and on behalf of Pauls ministry. Jesus is our Example of effectual, fervent praying beloved.Please note that Paul does not ask for prayer for his personal well-being or physical comfort in the imprisonment from which he wrote, but for boldness and faithfulness to continue proclaiming the gospel to the unsaved no matter what the cost. Even in prison Paul was not thinking of his own welfare but of his testimony for Christ.

My house shall be called a house of prayer- One of the things that the church is told to continue in is prayer. Personal prayer, prayer in your marriage, womens and mens prayer times.

Beloved, put on the whole armor of God and keep it on. Fight the good fight of faith today.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Even though Paul was in prison, he knew that the devil could only prevail in the lives of Gods children if they were unprepared. He wrote to equip them and comfort them.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6.24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The epistle ends with one word that sums up the Christian life from start to finish. The grace of God through The Lord Jesus Christ.

If you have not surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, than you are standing on the battlefield of life naked and without any protection against the lies and schemes of the enemy. Will you trust Him today?

This is the gospel that the risen Jesus told Paul to preach: Acts 26.18 "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."

If today, you are truly sorry for your sin and will repent and turn to Christ for forgiveness of your sin, He will not only forgive you, but He will provide for you the divine resources needed to deliver you from the power of Satan that has controlled your life.

Church family, is there an area of your life where the enemy is taking a victory lap around the track? Is he using you to slander or accuse others? Is he using you to harbor ill will and bitterness towards someone instead of forgive them as Christ forgave you? Have you believed his lies and deception regarding temptation and areas of the flesh instead of walking in the light as He is in the light?

There is one power that is not mentioned very often in today's culture, a power that we can all go to for forgiveness, healing, restoration and salvation.
That is power in The Name of Jesus Christ and His precious blood that grants forgiveness of sin. Believe it. Embrace it. Plead it. Apply it. Choose to walk todaystanding, not limping!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Philemon - Redemption and Reconciliation</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/philemon-redemption-and-reconciliation/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2014 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Paul-the-Apostle.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1148" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Paul-the-Apostle-1024x707.jpg" alt="Paul the Apostle" width="620" height="428" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Many bible scholars believe that this epistle was written at Rome during Paul's first imprisonment, nearly four years after his arrest at Jerusalem&lt;strong&gt; (Ac 21:33), &lt;/strong&gt;during all of which time he had been in bonds, but permitted to preach&lt;strong&gt;. See Ac 28:31.&lt;/strong&gt;

Philemon was one of Pauls prison epistles, but this one was the most personal of all. This letter was written at the same time that Paul wrote the Colossian epistle. When Paul wrote the Colossian epistle, he made mention that he was sending the letter with Tychicus, and that also Onesimus, who was one of their own, would be coming with Tychicus with the epistle.

A slave by the name of Onesimus (&lt;em&gt;whos name means profitable or useful&lt;/em&gt;) had robbed his master Philemon. He then ran for his life to the city of Rome where in the providence of God, he became acquainted with the apostle Paul. It was here that he heard Paul preach the gospel and came to the saving knowledge of The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/105010749"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

After hearing his testimony, Paul sent him back to his Christian master by the name of Philemon with the following letter of apology.

Some of the life lessons that this epistle teaches us is that:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Living God is the God of providence. There is no such thing as a coincidence in Gods universe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Living God is the God of redemption. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Only God can save us, we cannot save ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Living God is the God of reconciliation. Christ came into the world to reconcile and restore fallen mans fellowship with God. And Christ also came to reconcile and restore our fellowship with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ (&lt;/strong&gt;He refers to his chains five times in this letter&lt;strong&gt;), &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pauls crime and the reason for his incarceration was the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul here recognizes the sovereign hand of God upon his life as a disciple of The Lord Jesus Christ. He writes this epistle from a Roman prison, but he knows that he is not a prisoner of Rome; he is a &lt;strong&gt;prisoner of The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a servant of Jesus Christ, Pauls life was totally committed to the cause of Jesus Christ and to the care of Christ. So whatever happened to him in the line of duty, he received as coming from The Lord and for His purposes. Having been bought with a price, Paul was no longer in control of his life, Christ was.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perspective! My God is in control of my life, not me. What a tremendous effect this truth has upon your life, especially when things get tough or times get hard. &lt;strong&gt;My times are in His hands&lt;/strong&gt; said the Psalmist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;and Timothy our brother, &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Timothy was a young man who shadowed the apostle Paul and served alongside of him in the gospel. 1 and 2 Timothy were written to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philemon apparently he was a wealthy man, because he had slaves. Philemon was first and foremost a man of God and a fellow laborer of Pauls in the gospel of Jesus Christ... He had wealth, but wealth did not have him because His Master was Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is estimated that there were 60 million slaves in the world in those days. Slavery was a way of life in biblical times and it was not always bad thing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every single person in this sanctuary this morning has a master. By master I mean that something or someone that your life revolves aroundsomething or someone that is the prominent person or thing in your life. That something or someone that drives you to make the choices and live the way you do.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus said &lt;strong&gt;no man can serve two mastersyou cannot serve God and____________.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ekklesia; called out ones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) in thy house:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apphia is believed to be Philemons wife and how beautiful it is indeed to see a husband and wife, sold out for Jesus and serving Him together (&lt;em&gt;like Aquila and Priscilla&lt;/em&gt;). What a great example godly couples are for the children and grandchildren!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Archippus is a Christian brother. Please note the word &lt;strong&gt;fellow soldier. &lt;/strong&gt;As we saw a couple of weeks ago, Every Christianis commanded to put on the whole armor of God and to endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The church in thy house- &lt;/strong&gt;We know that there was no such thing as a church building per se until around the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; century. The early church either met in homes or in rented buildings (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 16:19; Col 4:15&lt;/strong&gt;). The church is people. The church is a living organism, not an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philemon had church meetings held in his home. Here is a wealthy man, evidently successful as well, but his home and his family belonged to Jesus and were open to the service of The King and His people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The order is always grace and then peace, or in some cases mercy. That is because we can never experience any other attribute of God until we first experience His saving grace that brings salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for grace not only refers to Gods unconditional and unmerited favor. It also refers to &lt;em&gt;the divine influence and favor upon the heart that finds its expression in ones life&lt;/em&gt;. In other words beloved, when the saving grace of Jesus is real in a persons life, the practical manifestation of the grace of God will always is visible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Barnabas came to Antioch, the Scriptures tell us, &lt;strong&gt;Ac 11:23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. &lt;/strong&gt;The saving grace of God produces believers, not make believers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4 I thank my God (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;an offering of thanksgiving to God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), making mention of thee always in my prayers,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The people that God uses are man and women of prayer. It is interesting how often Paul makes references to his own personal prayer life in each of the epistles. He makes mention of how that he is praying for them continually. And in some of them, how he is interceding for them night and day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul is chained to a Roman soldier and is not able to preach or teach as freely as when he is out on the streets. But he is able to do something that is even better. He is praying for the saints.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One sure way to express thanks to God for one another and help them grow in The Lord is by praying for that person.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We generally spend time in prayer for those who are in a crisis or sick, and we should do that. But in addition to that, I suggest that we follow Pauls pattern of praying for those who have made themselves and their homes available for the ministry of the saints and the furtherance of the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast (&lt;/strong&gt;first&lt;strong&gt;) toward the Lord Jesus, and (&lt;/strong&gt;secondly&lt;strong&gt;) toward all saints; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for the KJV &lt;strong&gt;communication &lt;/strong&gt;here is &lt;em&gt;Koinonia &lt;/em&gt;and it is used to describe the common faith and common life that believers have in Christ. But it carries a wider range of meanings, including the practical expressions of generosity, sharing, and fellowship that are put into action.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One translation reads, &lt;em&gt;put into action the generosity that comes from your faith in Christ. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philemons invisible faith in The Lord Jesus Christ was visibly demonstrated by his love for others practically. Scripture tells us that &lt;strong&gt;faith worketh by love&lt;/strong&gt;, and this love for Jesus Christ and one another is a verb, not simply some sentimental feelings. It is something that we demonstrate practically, not simply talk about.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James 2.17 &lt;/strong&gt;says that &lt;strong&gt;faith without works is dead. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any profession of faith in Jesus Christ that is not accompanied by action, is a false faith; a dead faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;In fact.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 John 3.16-18&lt;/strong&gt;, we are told that &lt;strong&gt;This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth (&lt;/strong&gt;NIV&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A genuine conversion is manifested by a life of good works that are motivated by a love for God and for His glory. Philemons faith in Christ was expressed towards others. The life of Philemon was a testimony of the grace of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The practical expressions of our faith stem from the&lt;strong&gt; acknowledgement of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. &lt;/strong&gt;It is so easy to join the world and their mantra of despair and gloom.Beloved, Peter writes that God has &lt;strong&gt;given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness thought the knowledge of Him Who has called us to glory and virtue. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yes the pains and sorrows that we face in life are real, but the way to combat those fiery darts of discouragement is by acknowledging all of the good things that we have in Christ Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The KJV word bowels speaks of that deepest part of mans being. Philemon was a minister of refreshment to others. The word refreshed means to &lt;em&gt;restore strength or revive; to arouse or stimulate. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When The Spirit of God is working in and through our lives, the effect will be that of refreshing others within the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul the aged. &lt;/strong&gt;Many scholars and bible teachers believe that Paul is at least 60 years old at this time. Though he was only 60, he speaks of himself as the aged. No doubt Paul looked much older than 60 due to the years of physical pain and toil as a result of persecution and the daily wear and tear of spiritual, emotional and mental effects because of his commitment to Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul makes this appeal to Philemon out of love, not from a position of apostolic boldness and authority. And so here is Paul. He could have used his authority as an apostle and command Philemon to forgive Onesimus and restore him. But rather than coming on heavy with authority and commanding Philemon in the Name of Jesus to let Onesimus go. He appeals to the higher law of love and asks that Philemon receive and restore Onesimus kindly and graciously as Christ has received and restored him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;10 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul was used by The Lord to lead Onesimus to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ while in prison in Rome. That is the idea behind the words &lt;strong&gt;my son&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;whom I have begotten in my bonds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
o &lt;strong&gt;1Cor 4:15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gods plan to save Onesimus was not at a bible study at Philemons home, but in a Roman prison cell through the apostle Paul. Oh the beautiful and often perplexing mystery of divine providence. It is happening in your life right now. You might not feel it, or understand it, but it is happening right now.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Can you see how the heavenly perspective we saw in verse 1 changed the way that Paul lived his life now? Paul was looking for the opportunities to serve The Lord in his prison instead of pout over the fact that he was in one (cp. &lt;strong&gt;Acts 16&lt;/strong&gt; when he and Silas were in prison). While bound he was used by Jesus to set Onesimus free.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is no cast system within the body of Christ. On planet earth there is only one race, and that is the human race. Here is Paul, a genius and former respected rabbi, befriending a slave, who in those days was no more than tools for their master to use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus doesnt look down from heaven upon you this morning as a tool to play with, but as someone who has been created in His image and likeness. &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 139&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that every single human is an image of God bearer who has been fearfully and wonderfully made. We were created to have fellowship with God, but sin has separated us from God, thus Christ Jesus came into the world deal with that sin problem and to seek and to save that, which was lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is a play on words that is descriptive of Onesimus before and after his conversion experience. He that was once &lt;strong&gt;unprofitable &lt;/strong&gt;to Philemonwould now be, by the grace of God, profitable, for the name Onesimus means profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This play on words provides a beautiful picture of the regenerating power of The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before we come to Christ, our lives, no matter how successful they appear to be externally, are unprofitable. As Solomon wrote in the Book of Ecclesiastes, any life that is not dedicated to The Lord Jesus Christ and for His glory is &lt;strong&gt;vanity&lt;/strong&gt; and unprofitable. &lt;strong&gt;What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;12 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In verse 13, Paul admits that he would have liked to keep Onesimus. Paul is here in prison. He is old and sick and cold. Onesimus could have been a tremendous help me. He would have liked to keep him there with him. But Paul would not make such an appeal without Philemons permission. If Philemon were to allow Onesimus to stay in Rome, Paul wanted that decision to be made willingly, and not out of force or necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, God does not want anything we do for Him or give to Him to be given out of necessity or out of pressure. God never uses pressure tactics on man. We are not to be motivated by guilt, the desire to be seen of men, but by a love for Christ and to bring Him glory and honor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Paul wrote to the Corinthians about the subject of giving to the work of The Lord. He said that our giving should never be done out of necessity, or pressure. When we give, we are to do so cheerfully, for God loves a cheerful, or in the Greek, a "hilarious" giver. So what you can give to God hilariously give, but what you can't give hilariously keep. It is better that you keep it than to give it to God grudgingly. God doesn't want anything done in a grudging way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, God does not want us to gripe and moan and pout when we give or serve Him. That is insulting to Him and a misrepresentation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever (&lt;/strong&gt;i.e. Onesimus departure was providential&lt;strong&gt;); 16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In other words, Paul asks Philemon to consider the sovereignty of God in this matter. Whatever evil had happened in the past, God turned that around for the good. Now rarely do we know what God is working out in our lives when we experience unexpected disappointments or losses. When Onesimus took the money and split, Philemon was no doubt very upset. And he probably was saying, why would God allow him to rip me off like that and take off?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And Paul says, look, you may never know why God allowed all of this to happen. But we do know that all things work together for good to those who love God and are the called according to His purposes. For it was while he was in Rome that he came to the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Now he's an eternal brother in Christ. So you lost him for a moment but you gained him forever. He's now an eternal brother in the bond of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philemon could have legally had Onesimus murdered, but, having been shown so much grace by God through Jesus Christ, how could he possibly refuse extending grace to another sinner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Since you count me as a partner, I want you to receive him just like you would receive me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put that on my account- &lt;/strong&gt;This Greek phrase &lt;strong&gt;put that on my acount&lt;/strong&gt; is translated "&lt;em&gt;imputed&lt;/em&gt;" in &lt;strong&gt;Rom. 5:13&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul asked Philemon to impute or reckon Onesimus's debt against Paul's account and to receive him as he would receive Paul himself.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is a beautiful illustration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Imputation means that because of Christs sacrifice on the cross for our sin, the totality of the sin debt that we owed God was placed upon Him. Thus, when we believe the gospel and receive Christ as Lord&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;His perfect righteousness becomes (&lt;em&gt;is imputed unto us&lt;/em&gt;) as our righteousness. Our righteousness, or right standing with God &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; earned or deserved; it is &lt;em&gt;imputed &lt;/em&gt;unto us by grace through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That is what it means to be in Christaccepted in the Beloved. Oh, what a picture this is of the way God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ accept you and accept me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philemon was indebted to Paul, as the instrument of his conversion and salvation. Paul was a soul winner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you remember the instrument that The Lord used to lead you to Christ?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written with my own hand-&lt;/strong&gt;The mention of Pauls autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing someone to write for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would bring joy to Pauls heart to hear that Philemon and Onesimus friendship and relationship was restored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will do more than I say- &lt;/strong&gt;Paul expresses his confidence in him and is sure that Philemon will do more than he requests. It is characteristic of real believers to do more than is requested. Jesus asks us to go the second mile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The fact that Paul accepts his imprisonment as being the will of God presently doesnt stop him from praying for his release from prison. Paul believed that providence and prayer works hand in hand.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus (&lt;/strong&gt;a Colossian, imprisoned with Paul&lt;strong&gt;); 24 Marcus (&lt;/strong&gt;John Mark&lt;strong&gt;), Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story of the once severed but now mended relationship between Paul and Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Acts 15:3840; 2 Tim. 4:11) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;would have been well known to the believers in Colossae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Col. 4:10). Listing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marks name here would serve to remind Philemon that Paul himself had worked through the issues of forgiveness, and that the instructions he was passing on to his friend were ones the apostle himself had already implemented in his relationship with John Mark. &lt;/em&gt;J.MacStudy Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demas- 2 Tim 4.10 Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world. &lt;/strong&gt;Demas stopped fighting the good fight of faithnobody forsakes The Lord overnightit usually happens gradually with a little compromise here and a little compromise there.the proverbial frog in the frying pan illustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This letter that makes an appeal for grace ends with a request for a blessing of grace.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gods Riches At Christs Expense. Gods Righteousness At Christs Expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus Christ came to call sinners to repentance! When you repent of your sin and turn to Christ, God imputes unto you complete forgiveness and pardon for Christs sake. Your sin debt is cancelled upon the merits of Christs sacrifice.

At the moment of conversion, a miracle of grace takes place deep within, and The Spirit of God begins working in you from the inside out. Your life that was once a waste of The Creators talents and abilities will now be used for His glory and honor, which is the very purpose for Him giving them to you in the first place.

Perhaps you are dealing with a relationship with another person that has gone bad like with Onesimus and Philemon. There are two ways of dealing with a relationship gone wrong. Your way or Gods way. Gods way is the way of the cross.

How has God forgiven you and why? Freely and unconditionally. Will you forgive them, as Christ has forgiven you?

&lt;strong&gt;Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, forgiveness is to be unlimited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). Luke 17.3,4&lt;/strong&gt;

Do the math, beloved. 7 times in one day is once every 3 hours and 25 minutes! This is another way of Jesus telling us that if we find it hard to forgive someone who has hurt us and asks us to forgive them 7 times in one day, we have no idea how many times we offend God each and every day, and yet He extends grace, mercy and forgiveness!

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>10For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek toplease men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

1Th 2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

Whenever we are presented with an opportunity to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, we will either dance around the real issue out of fear of man, or we will speak the truth in love to please God.

Albert Barnes wrote, A professing Christian, and especially a minister, should be alarmed when the world flatters and caresses him. He should fear either.

What Paul is saying in verse 10 is that when a person professing to follow Jesus Christ seeks to please man (making pleasing man his or her aim), that ultimately will disqualify them from being a faithful servant of Jesus Christ.

To be a follower of Jesus Christ means that we regulate our conduct and conversation concerning the gospel according to the will of God, whether men are pleased with it or not. And it must be further noted, that the life and behavior of a sincere Christian will sometimes offend and oftentimes displease men, because light and darkness cannot peacefully coexist.

I think of Enoch, who in the days before the flood had this testimony that he pleased God. Pleasing God will many times displease fallen man.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;11But I certify you, brethren that the gospel, which was preached of me, is not after man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To certify means to declare, as in 1 Corinthians 15.1: I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you.....Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and thatHe rose again the third day according to theScriptures.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Remember, the Judaizers who were attacking Pauls authority and message were religious zealots who were saying that Pauls gospel had left some very important parts out. Namely, adherence to the ceremonial law as necessary for salvation.

That is always the message of the legalist, the ceremonialist or the good works humanist. The work of Jesus Christ is not enough. There must be something else or something more to do.

Only someone with apostolic authority could have put a stop to this damnable heresy that was being thrust upon the Galatians. So we have Paul defending the fact that his gospel was not second-hand message that was inferior to what the other apostles were preaching, but the very same gospel.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel that Paul taught was not learned in a seminary or bible school. Paul is certainly not denigrating people being taught the gospel. He is simply stating that he had to clarify that the authority and message that he delivered came directly from the Lord and not from man.

The revelation that Jesus gave to Paul took place during the three years during which he sojourned in Arabia (Ga 1:17,18), in the vicinity of the scene of the giving of the law.

Paul's apostolic calling was grounded in divine revelation from Jesus Christ. Just as Christ called the Twelve, so was Paul called. Just as the Twelve received the gospel directly from Christ, so did Paul (Acts 9:36; 26:1318).

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation and Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;

Since the truth of God came into this world viarevelation, the only way that it enters into our hearts isby illumination of The Spirit. Flesh and blood cannot reveal to us the truth of Gods Word. (Peters confession in (Matthew 16.)

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Co 2:11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Bible is not an impersonal book that is to be looked upon like any other great book. It is the revelation of God and as such, it can only be understood for the great redemptive that it is declaration when God opens hearts and sin- darkened minds. Acts 16.14 Lydia, whose heart The Lord opened.

Spiritual truth can only be understood by the illuminating work of The Spirit of God.

Salvation is God's work, not ours.The command of the risen Jesus to the church is togo into the entire world and do two things:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;preach the gospel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;make disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
We are called to share our faith with the lost, butlike of the Day of Pentecost, we are not responsible to make people believe; we plant and water but God it's the Spirit of God that must convict a person of sin, righteousness and judgment, not my clever or eloquent presentation.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Before we move on, may we never forget that the Scriptures you and I hold in our hands are indeed the very word of God. The Holy Scriptures are His inspired revelation to us (2 Tim 3.16,17).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They will last longer than the present heaven and earth (Matt 24.35).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They testify of the salvation that is by faith in Jesus (John 5.39).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were written to give us comfort and hope (Rom 15.4).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were written to reveal Gods prophetic plan for the ages (Daniel, Revelation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matt 4.4 Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Sola Scriptura, not sola church history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
By the time of the writing of the Revelation, the church had already begun to drift away from "Thus saith The Lord."

In verses 13-16, Paul gives his personal testimony of theilluminating work of God's Spirit in his own life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;13For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 14And profited in the Jews religion above many of my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The best commentary on verses 13 and 14 are found in Acts &amp;amp; Phil 3.5,6
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Php 3:5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul was a Pharisee, he was well educated, he exceedingly zealous of the traditions of the Jews, but hewas a fierce opponent of Jesus Christ and those who were born again.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Paul made a determined effort to destroy Christianity.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ac 9:1 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ac 22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acts 26:10 many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Observe here, saints, that Paul was doing everything that he could to stamp out Christianity and destroy the church. And he was doing it for the Lord; or at least he thought he was. His motives for destruction were pure in his mind. Becoming a follower of Jesus Christ was the last thing Paul would have considered on his own!

Paul was perfectly satisfied with his own religious practice and saw no need for the message of the gospel. He was comfortable being zealous for all of the ancestral traditions found within Judaism.

Jesus Christ, in His glorious Person and saving work, was a mystery to Paul until Jesus revealed Himself to him.

What I find interesting is that, even though Paul was extremely religious to the bone, his own testimonyregarding his true spiritual condition before he was born again is 1Ti 1:13 "Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious."

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Do you know what Paul called these religious zealots who were attacking his apostleship and the gospel of the grace of God?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phil 3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phil 3.18 The enemies of the cross of Christ:19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is theirbelly, and whose glory is in their shame, whomind earthly things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul did not hesitate to point out to his opponents, like those in Galatia, that being a Jew, even a zealous Jew, is not sufficient for salvation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mothers womb (merit in an individual has nothing to do with their salvation or their calling into the ministry),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul tells us here that I was once a Pharisee, which means a separated one, but God in His wonderful grace has separated me to something far better.

God had this to say about Jeremiah, Jer 1:5 "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."

Even though this separation was from his mother's womb, we see this separation process unfold in human history on the road to Damascus and then was confirmed in Ac 13:2 "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ro 1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Please note that Pauls primary calling was to be a servant, or bond slave of The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His separation was unto the gospel of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He lived totally for His Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;and called me by his grace, 16To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen (Gentiles); immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Note that it was by the grace of God that Paul was called into the ministry. Pauls call to be an apostle, like the faith of every believer, was the product of Gods grace. No one can earn Gods call; it is a free gift.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2Ti 1:9 Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Please note in vs. 16 that Paul says that his calling was to reveal Jesus through him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gal 2.20 Christ liveth in me is what authentic Christianity is all about. Beloved, the primary purpose for God redeeming us is that Jesus Christ would be revealed in your life. Christ in you, the hope of glory!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Both Paul's salvation and his life-purpose were bound up in the pleasure of knowing and pleasing God. To whom much is given, much is required.

Our vocations and callings may vary, but our one purpose in life as a Christian is that the Jesus Christ be revealed and glorified in us and through us.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia (not recorded in Acts, but this period of isolation fits between vv. 22 and 23 of Acts 9.), and returned again unto Damascus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We do read that when he returned to Damascus Ac 9:20 "And straightway he preached Christ in thesynagogues, that he is the Son of God. 21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? 22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

To say that seeing and hearing Paul preach Christ took the people by surprise is an understatement. That would be like the Pope standing in St Peters Square and declaring, you must be born again or you will not enter into the kingdom of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;18Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul spent the first 3 years after his conversion alone with The Lord, during which time he received this revelation of the gospel of the grace of God. Note that after Paul received his calling from Jesus, it was not necessary for him to confer with flesh and blood (vs 16).

Why then do we read about Pauls meeting with the original apostles of Jesus that he tells us about here and in chapter 2? It was not to get approval from them, but to do things decently and in order.

The purpose of Paul's visit to Peter was to become acquainted with him rather than to confer with him.

Even though Paul was called directly by Jesus Christ, he did not run around like a "loose canon" unaccountable to anyone.In fact, in his pastoral epistles, Paul lays out quite clearly the qualifications and lifestyle that is to be sought after of those called into the ministry.

These men that were called and anointed by Gods grace to preach the gospel were men who were in fellowship with other believers and accountable to the authority placed over them by The Lord.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;19But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lords brother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Contrary to the myths of the Catholic Church, the bible clearly teaches that Jesus had siblings.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mt 13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 56 And his sisters, are they not all with us?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
James, the Lords brother, at first did not believe in Jesus (John 7:5) but later was converted, perhaps as a result of seeing the risen Lord (1Cor 15:7).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;20Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 21Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As he traveled through the regions of Syria and Cilicia, he founded the churches that he subsequently returned to and confirmed in the faith (Ac 15:23,41).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;22And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 23But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 Verse 23 tells me that I should never write a person off as someone who will never come to the saving knowledge of Jesus because he or she presently is vocally opposed to the gospel.

The one time archenemy of the gospel was saved and converted by the grace of God to proclaim very gospel and Jesus that he set out to destroy.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;24And they glorified God in me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Please note that the people glorified God for the work that God was doing in the life of Paul. This is what a proper understanding of the grace of grace does. It causes one to glorify the Giver of the grace, not the gift or the instrument through whom the grace of Godflows. Paul rebuked the church in Corinth for talkingmore about Peter, Apollos or him than Jesus Christ.

Paul's testimony is one of God's grace from start tofinish, so that all of the glory in salvation belongs to the Lord God. Such is true of every sinner who is saved by grace. To God be the glory, great things He has done!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/strong&gt;

The testimony of the apostle Paul clearly reveals that nothing blinds a person from the knowledge of the truth more than religion. Pauls pre-Christian religious zeal was not only insufficient; it actually blinded him from seeing his need for Christ. Like many of his lost fellow Jews, who zealously sought to establish their own moral righteousness (Rom. 10:23), Paul had formerly been zealous for the traditions of my fathers (Gal. 1:14).

Listen to the personal testimony of Martin Luther, taken from page 35 of his commentary on the book of Galatians. Before I was lightened with the knowledge of the gospel, I was as zealous for the papistical law and traditions of the fathers as ever any were, maintaining and defending them as holy and necessary to salvation. Moreover I endeavored to keep them myself, as much as was possible for me to do, punishing my poor body with fasting, watching, praying, and other exercises, more than all they which at this day do so bitterly hate and persecute me, because now I take from them the glory of justifying by works and merits. For I was so diligent and superstitious in the observation hereof, that I laid more upon my body, than without danger of health, I was able to bear.... but whatsoever I did, I did it with a single heart, of a good zeal, and for the glory of God. But those things which were then gain unto me, I now, with Paul count to be but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Both Martin Luther and the apostle Paul would be the first to admit that neither Judaism nor Catholicism (or Protestantism)could save them. So do we.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They both knew that there was nothing good or worthy within themselves to merit salvation. So do we.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They both knew that they deserved the judgment of God.So do we.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Neither Luther nor Paul had any power to save themselves. Neither do we.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Neither Luther nor Paul understood the way of salvation until the Spirit of God revealed the majesty and salvation that is in Jesus Christ revealed alone.The same is true in our lives as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

That is the message of free, unmerited grace, beloved.

The Bible is clear that all men are called upon to repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the goodness of God that leads us to repentance. God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Scripture says to examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?

Have you been born from above? Have you been born again? Religion is fallen mans futile attempts to earn or merit fellowship with God based upon observing religious rituals or ordinances or by doing good works.

Religion is a form of godliness with no power to forgive sin or save your eternal soul.Salvation by my good works is saying that the holy blood of Jesus Christ is insufficient to save my soul.

Only the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ can save our souls and give unto us eternal life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Jo 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life,which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section"&gt;
&lt;div class="layoutArea"&gt;
&lt;div class="column"&gt;

Religion will make you sour instead of soar....it will bum you out instead of bless you....and that is because the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.

When a person tells me that they are a Christian but their walk is one series of sour experiences and one bummer after another, something deep in my heart tells me that what they are experiencing is a form of Christianity that denies the power of a real relationship with Jesus Christ....that is the entire message of the book of Galatians.

Loving Jesus makes worship a joy....serving a joy....prayer meetings and fellowship, a joy.....joy unspeakable and full of glory. Count it all joy. Do not accept any cheap substitutes.

Its not about religion; its about a relationship with Jesus.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Talking about death is never easy. Words cannot even begin to describe the gamut of emotions that are being felt right now. Nevertheless, death is as much a part of human existence as is birth. The book of Ecclesiastes tells us that there is a time to be born, and there is a time to die. The book of Hebrews tells us that it is appointed unto men once to die. So whether it is a discussion that we like to have, it is a discussion that we cannot avoid, because death is an unavoidable experience that awaits every
single person here this morning.

Today, I want to present to you from God's Word the cause of death and the one and only power that is stronger than death, and that is the gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ.

In a matter of a few days, Christendom will be celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Christmas message is a message of redemption. In the gospel of Matthew, we read in chapter 1.20-23 "the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might befulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bringforth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, whichbeing interpreted is, God with us."

Dear family and friends,The Lord Jesus Christ is here with us today.

Note that Matthew tells us that Jesus, Emmanuel, came tosave His people from their sins. Christmas is a redemptionmessage. Christmas is the message of God's gift to us. But, tounderstand the cause of death and the power of the gospel, wemust understand what sin is and where it began. To do this, wehave to rewind the time machine of human history and go back toAdam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Genesis 2.8,9 "And the Lord God planted a garden eastwardin Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow everytree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; thetree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree ofknowledge of good and evil."

Genesis 2.16, 17 "And the Lord God commanded the man,saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thoushalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereofthou shalt surely die."

Well, we all know the outcome of this story. Adam and Evedisobeyed God and ate of the tree of the knowledge of good andevil, and they died. What was the cause of Adam and Eve'sdeath? Sin. Disobedience to God. The consequence of their sinthat they died spiritually. However, the Bible goes on to tell usthat after Adam and Eve died spiritually, they went on to live formany more years, and Eve gave birth to two sons, Cain and Abel.Eventually, Adam and Eve died physically.

So, death in the bible does mean the end of existence. Deathin Scripture means a separation, and must be understood in twoways. (1) Physical death, which is separation from the body, and(2) spiritual death, which is separation from God. Every humanbeing is created in the image of God, but we are also bornsinners, dead in trespasses and sins. In other words, everyhuman being is biologically related to God as Creator, but we arespiritually separated from being in His family by our sin.

Now, atthis juncture, I have to tell you something about sin. The badnews and good news.

The bad news is that all of us, especially the guy talking toyou, are sinners by nature and by choice with no ability in and ofourselves to bridge the gap between us and a holy God. Becauseour consciences cannot deal with the guilt and consequences ofsin, we try to atone for our sin with religion; but religion cannottake away our sin. We try to atone for our sin by giving to good causes or by doing good works; but giving to good causes anddoing good works cannot take away our sin. The only way toescape the need of atonement for my sin is by being born sinlessand living a perfect life.

Well, that is impossible for every one ofus. Enter Emmanuel, The Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is the virginborn, sinless Savior. He came to save us from our sins. That iswhat Matthew meant when he said that Jesus came to save Hispeople from their sins. Saved from what I used to ask? Savedfrom the debt, penalty and power of my sin. That is why thegospel means Good News! If we could atone for our sin by doinggood, then the death of Jesus Christ on the cross is meaningless.

Luke's account of the Christmas story reads, "And there werein the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keepingwatch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of theLord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shoneround about them: and they were sore afraid. And theangel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring yougood tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. Forunto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,which is Christ the Lord."

How does The Savior save us? By living a perfect life, and bydying on the cross as the one and only perfect sacrifice for oursin. By His death on the cross, The Lord Jesus Christ provides afull payment for all of my sin, and when I by faith admit my sinfuland lost condition and embrace Him as Lord and Savior of my life,
God counts me righteous before Him, and gives unto me the giftof eternal life. The wages of sin is death, and the gift of Godis eternal life through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Salvation is agift. It cannot be earned. And it is notdeserved. It is received by grace alone, through faith alone, inChrist alone.

The bible explains being saved this way in John 3.14-17, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, evenso must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoeverbelieveth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begottenSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into theworld to condemn the world; but that the world throughhim might be saved.

Listen to how a man in Scripture finds salvation through faithin Jesus Acts 16.29-31 "Then he called for a light, andsprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Pauland Silas, And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what mustI do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord JesusChrist, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."

Listen to the words of assurance that Jesus spoke at afuneral. John 11.25-27 "Jesus said unto her, I am the
resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, thoughhe were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth andbelieveth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? Shesaith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art theChrist, the Son of God, which should come into the world."

Let me leave you with this appeal from Romans 10.9-13 "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised himfrom the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart manbelieveth unto righteousness; and with the mouthconfession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith,Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Forthere is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: forthe same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shallbe saved."

Yes, we die physically, but through faith in Jesus Christ, to beabsent from the body means to be present with The Lord forever.

Life is short, death is sure, sin the cause, and Christ the cure.

To choose to live without Jesus Christ on earth, is to choose tolive apart from Him for all eternity. May God open your eyes and your heart to trust Jesus Christ this morning as your Savior andchoose to follow Him as your Lord.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Acts 2.23,24 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.

The resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ is the peg upon which our faith rests. This morning, let us read and mediate upon some passages that speak of His glorious resurrection.

Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. Through faith in the risen Lord Jesus, we are made whole.

Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Through faith in the risen, exalted Jesus we are given he gifts of repentance and remission of sins.

For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. It is through faith in the risen Lord Jesus that we are brought unto God The Father.

Beloved, draw near to God this morning with confidence and faith in The Risen, Exalted Lord Jesus. Because Jesus lives, we too have life.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Galatians 3:10-19: Resting, or Wrestling, with God?</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>As Pastor Ben mentioned last week, we are now in the doctrinal portion of the book of Galatians. One of the most important purposes of Scripture is to reveal to us God centered, Christ exalting doctrine.

This week and next week (Lord willing), we will be covering verses 10-29 and dividing it up this way:

Gal 3.10-14 The Curse of the Law

Gal 3.15-18 The Promise of the Covenant

Gal 3.19-29 The Purpose of the law

The New Testament emphasizes what God has done for us. The Church has made the mistake of emphasizing what we should do for God, and in doing so; we have drifted away from God and Christ centered life of love, faith, grace and fruit in the power of The Holy Spirit, to a man and self centered the life of law, legalism, dead works, and the flesh.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law (&lt;/strong&gt;lit. &lt;em&gt;all who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the law of rituals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) are under the curse: for it is written (Deut 27:26), Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul's argument seeks to drive his opponents into a corner from which there is no escape. "&lt;em&gt;Suppose you decide that you are going to try to win God's approval by accepting and obeying the law, what is the, inevitable consequence&lt;/em&gt;?"

First of all, the man who does that has to stand or fall by his decision; if he chooses the law he has got to live by it.

Second, no man ever has succeeded and no man ever will succeed in always keeping the law.

Third, if that being so, you are accursed, because scripture itself says (&lt;strong&gt;27:26&lt;/strong&gt;) that the man who does not keep the whole law is under a curse. Therefore, the inevitable end of trying to get right with God by making the law the principle of life is a curse.

The word curse here means, &lt;em&gt;to be condemned and doomed to punishment by the righteous judgment of God&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Because if you attempt to be made right with God by human effort, there is no room for one single error. It is impossible for a sinner to save themselves.

The book of James puts it this way:

&lt;strong&gt;Jas 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.&lt;/strong&gt;

The law demanded perfect, sinless obedience, and if you broke &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the commands of God, you have broken and guilty of breaking the entire law.

Not a single person here today, myself at the very top of the list, should be so self-deceived as to think we are able to perfectly obey the law of God.

The law was given by God to show us our inadequacy and our need of His saving grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ; the law was never intended to make men righteous.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Heb 7:19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.&lt;/strong&gt;

If Gods holy, perfect law could not justify us in the sight of God, but only declare us guilty and point us to the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, how can any person, &lt;em&gt;now that Jesus has come and fulfilled all of the holy and righteous requirements of the law&lt;/em&gt;, really believe that their salvation depends upon their keeping of the rituals or rules of their denomination? Its absurd, its heresy, its impossible.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

Having shown from the Old Testament that the law inevitably brings a curse upon fallen humanity, Paul now shows that the same Old Testament scriptures also revealed a way for sinful man to enter into a right relationship with God.

&lt;strong&gt;Habakkuk 2:4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;proud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith. &lt;/strong&gt;

In quoting &lt;strong&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/strong&gt; Paul shows that pride in human effort or accomplishments proves that a person is not right in the sight of God. This is most clearly explained by Jesus teaching in &lt;strong&gt;Luke 18.9-14 &lt;/strong&gt;about the prideful attitude of the Pharisee in the temple.

&lt;strong&gt;Luke 18:9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;

Like this self-righteous Pharisee, it is only a proud person or a legalist who believes that they are good enough to stand before God upon the basis of their own self-justifying religious activity or good works. (Nicodemus, Cornelius, Paul himself)

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 5.5&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble&lt;/strong&gt;.

The Scripture is very clear that the only way for a sinner to enter into a vital relationship with The Lord and live a life that is pleasing to Him is by grace, through faith.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 11:6, but without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.&lt;/strong&gt;

Threetimes we find this phrase, &lt;strong&gt;the just shall live by faith in the New Testament. &lt;/strong&gt;Here in Galatians and

&lt;strong&gt;Rom 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Heb 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.&lt;/strong&gt;

Then just shall live-&lt;em&gt;really live&lt;/em&gt;-by faith. And Paul will go on to tell us in &lt;strong&gt;Gal 5.6&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;faith worketh by love. &lt;/strong&gt;

Because faith worketh by love, a gospel relationship with God is a loving one, not a legalistic one. A gospel-centered life of faith will be a life that is rooted and grounded in the love of Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.12 And the law is not of faith (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;does not require faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul here quotes&lt;strong&gt;Leviticus 18.5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The law is not of faith-&lt;/strong&gt; The law is not based on what God has done, but on what I am doing. The law is performance based, and is not based on Gods grace but on my doing. The law says that you must do it and keep doing it. Faith says, &lt;strong&gt;it is finished. &lt;/strong&gt;

Seeking to be accepted by God on the basis of my obedience to the law is not only impossible. According to &lt;strong&gt;Habakkuk 2.4&lt;/strong&gt;, it is an act of arrogant, spiritual pride.

Salvation according to a religious person or a legalist is always rooted in &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; and is based upon what they have done or dont do instead of trusting in the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ.

This is clearly seen in Scripture in the account of the Pharisee in

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word for the English word &lt;strong&gt;redeemed&lt;/strong&gt; is "&lt;em&gt;exagorazo&lt;/em&gt;" and it means &lt;em&gt;to purchase for oneself by the payment of their debt. It was a word that was used to describe the buying of a slaves freedom by paying their debt.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 6.20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus redeemed us from the curse of the law with His precious blood.

&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 19 &lt;em&gt;But with the precious blood of Christ&lt;/em&gt;, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.13...&lt;/strong&gt;being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul quotes &lt;strong&gt;Deuteronomy 21:23&lt;/strong&gt; in referring to what happened when Christ died upon the cross. Christ took upon Himself the curse of sin when he suffered the penalty of sin on the cross and died for us. (&lt;strong&gt; 53:1-11; John 1:29&lt;/strong&gt;)

&lt;strong&gt;Mt 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2.9 But we see Jesus, Who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; the He by the grace of God should taste death for every man&lt;/strong&gt;

Like the symbolic scape-goat spoken of in &lt;strong&gt;Le 16:5-26, &lt;/strong&gt;Jesus was the representative bearer of the sin and the curse, which God required.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3. 14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.2 received ye The Spirit by the works of the law, of by the hearing of faith? &lt;/strong&gt;

We receive and are sealed with The Holy Spirit the very moment of our salvation.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though &lt;em&gt;it be&lt;/em&gt; but a man's covenant, yet &lt;em&gt;if it be&lt;/em&gt; confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. &lt;/strong&gt;

A covenant, or agreement, among men, after it is ratified, cannot be annulled or altered without the consent of both parties.

The covenant God made with Abraham &lt;em&gt;was based on faith&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;not works&lt;/em&gt;. So when the law was added 430 years later, it didnt disannul the covenant that stated that the faith of Abraham would be accounted for righteousness.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul takes one word in the Abraham story and erects an argument upon it. As the King James Version translates &lt;strong&gt;17:7-8&lt;/strong&gt;, God says to Abraham, "&lt;strong&gt;I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee&lt;/strong&gt;" and says of his inheritance, "&lt;strong&gt;I will give it unto thee and to thy seed after thee.&lt;/strong&gt;"

Paul's argument is that seed is used in the singular and not in the plural; and that, therefore, God's promise points not to a great crowd of people but to one single individual; and--argues Paul--the one person in whom the covenant finds its consummation is Jesus Christ. Therefore, the way to peace with God is the way of faith that Abraham took; and we must repeat that way by looking to Jesus Christ in faith.

Our relationship with God is based upon the earlier covenant made with Abraham and His Seed, Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:17 And this I say, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. &lt;/strong&gt;

Pauls point was simply this; &lt;em&gt;The law was given many years after the covenant that God made with Abraham, and cannot therefore cancel the previous covenant. The Mosaic Law did not nullify the promise made to Abraham.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:18 For if the inheritance &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; of the law, &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt; no more of promise: but God gave &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; to Abraham by promise. &lt;/strong&gt;

Law and promise exclude each other. The law knows nothing of grace. The law demands absolute obedience, as its only condition of justification.

The covenant with Abraham was an everlasting covenant, and its very principle was based upon a promise, not works; faith, not personal merit.

&lt;strong&gt;For those of us who are in Christ Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those of us who are in Christ Jesus&lt;/span&gt;, let us hear afresh the words of Paul regarding how the gospel forever impacted his life and the way that he lived.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5.14,15 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.&lt;/strong&gt;

Remember beloved, Christ bought you with a price to free you and me from being slaves to sin, self and the world. &lt;strong&gt;For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those of you who have yet to receive Jesus Christ as Lord&lt;/span&gt;, we learned today that sin and the curse of the law are inseparable. Wherever sin is, there will be the ultimate consequence of sin, death. The penalty of the law is its dreadful curse- the sentence of death. &lt;strong&gt;Romans 6.23 The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Scripture declares, &lt;strong&gt;Acts 13.38-40 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you&lt;/strong&gt;

Thus, the only way for sinners to be freed from the curse of the law and to be justified in the sight of God is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Embrace The Lordship of Jesus Christ today my friend.

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11.28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Come unto me.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the call of the gospel. To whom is the invitation made?

&lt;strong&gt;Labor and heavy laden.&lt;/strong&gt; Loaded, burdened with the guilt of sin and fear of judgment, which was only made worse by the legalistic teachings of the Pharisees.

&lt;strong&gt;Give you rest.&lt;/strong&gt; Christ relieves the burden by saving from sin and guilt. There is a rest, which Jesus gives, and it is the rest of redemption. &lt;strong&gt;Isa 11.10&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;His rest shall be glorious&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Take my yoke. &lt;/strong&gt;The yoke was that wooden harness that they put upon the oxen so that they could pull the plow. Salvation is being yoked to Jesus Christ as ones Lord, Master, and Teacher.

&lt;strong&gt;Learn of Me&lt;/strong&gt;. This is another way of saying; grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. We grow in Christ by reading His Word. Through prayer. As we grow in Jesus, we learn more and more that He is &lt;strong&gt;meek and lowly in heart. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;My yoke is easy&lt;/strong&gt;. The yoke of salvation is &lt;strong&gt;easy &lt;/strong&gt;because The Lord Jesus Christ does all the work of salvation.

&lt;strong&gt;My burden is light&lt;/strong&gt;. The burden is light because the weight of our salvation rests upon His shoulders. He carries us.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3.19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Law would be a bad thing &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; it were given to bring spiritual life &amp;amp; then failed to do so! [But no law can bring life!]

The law was not given by God to make men better but to make man The law was given to show us our sin, that we might be stripped of our self-righteousness. That we might be humbled, terrified, bruised, broken, and by the love of God, driven to seek His grace through faith in that blessed Seed, The Lord Jesus Christ.

The law &lt;strong&gt;was added &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;because of transgressions&lt;/strong&gt;. The law was formally given at Sinai for the purpose of convicting of sin, not to replace the covenant of grace, but to assist it, thus leading sinners to Christ (v. 24).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 5&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;20,21 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 7.7,8 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Therefore the function of the law was to define sin. Remember this, beloved: where there is no law, there is no sin. A man cannot be condemned for doing wrong if there was no law stating that what he did was wrong. But, while the law can and does define sin, it can do nothing whatever to cure it.

The law was added to reveal mans utter sinfulness, inability to save himself, and desperate need of a Savior.&lt;!--more--&gt;

The law was never intended to be the way of salvation. The law was never given to be a savior, or to secure a right standing before God. The law was a schoolmaster or tutor (v. 24) that was given to point us to Christ

&lt;strong&gt;Ordained by angels.&lt;/strong&gt; Literally, Appointed through angels (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 7.53; Hebrews 2.2)&lt;/strong&gt;. I have no idea what this means.

&lt;strong&gt;3.20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.&lt;/strong&gt;

Now a mediator is necessary if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is One, did not use a mediator when He gave His promise to Abraham.

Because God is One (Father, Son &amp;amp; Spirit), His ultimate revelation comes not through an intermediary but from Himself alone.

What is the biblical definition of a mediator? &lt;em&gt;It is One who represents God to humans and humans to Godand who removes all alienation between them by offering himself as a ransom for all&lt;/em&gt;

Thus, the only individual qualified to be a mediator between God and man He had to be both God and man. Thus, the One and only Person Who qualifies to be the Mediator between man and God is Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 2.5,6 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 8.6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 9.15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 12.24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. &lt;/strong&gt;

Again, the law and the promises (the gospel) are not in conflict but in perfect harmony. The purpose of the law was not to give life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 3.31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it. Paul keeps driving this nail of the purpose of the law and its inability to save us over and over.

Let me repeat. The Law demanded righteousness but was powerless to provide it. Its function was to prepare for the gospel by making people conscious of their sin and their need of a Savior.

God was not surprised that the Israelites were unable to obey the law. In fact, at the end of the giving of the law, Moses foretold that the Israelites would not obey it (&lt;strong&gt; 31:2429&lt;/strong&gt;). In &lt;strong&gt;Exodus 20.24-26, &lt;/strong&gt;the first command that God gave unto Israel after giving them the 10 commandments was to build an altar for sacrifices.

&lt;strong&gt;3.22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;All under sin-&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 3.9,10 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
By &lt;strong&gt;faith &lt;/strong&gt;here&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; Paul means new covenant faith in Christ. Since Paul has already used Abraham as an example of justification by faith (vv. 69, 14, 18), he does not mean that there was no saving faith before Christ came. &lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 11&lt;/strong&gt; clearly teaches us that. He means that OT believers did not have the full knowledge of Christs finished work.

&lt;strong&gt;All under sin- &lt;/strong&gt;The Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin. We are born into this world sinner both by nature and by choice. We receive Gods promise of salvation and the promise of The Holy Spirit, by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. All under sin means that we are incapable and powerless to save ourselves.

&lt;strong&gt;3.23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. &lt;/strong&gt;

In other words, until the way of grace through faith in Jesus Christ was manifested, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.

&lt;strong&gt;3.24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Schoolmaster&lt;/strong&gt;-William Barclay writes this insightful comment about this individual.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Greek world there was a household servant called the paidagogos. He was not the schoolmaster. He was usually an old and trusted slave who had been long in the family and whose character was high. He was in charge of the child's moral welfare and it was his duty to see that he acquired the qualities essential to true manhood. He had one particular duty; every day he had to take the child to and from school. He had nothing to do with the actual teaching of the child, but it was his duty to take him in safety to the school and deliver him to the teacher. That--said Paul--was like the function of the law. It was there to lead a man to Christ.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

So once again we learn that the purpose of the law was to bring a man to Christ by showing him that by himself he was utterly unable to keep it. But once a man had come to Christ he no longer needed the law, for now he was dependent not on law but on grace. That we are no longer under the law, but under grace is the main message of Galatians and Hebrews.

&lt;strong&gt;3.26 For ye are all the children of God (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) by faith in Christ Jesus. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Children of God- &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word used for children is a legal term used in the adoption and inheritance laws of first-century Rome. It is used elsewhere in Pauls letters (compare &lt;strong&gt;4:57; Rom. 8:1416, 23&lt;/strong&gt;).

Having been adopted into Gods family by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, we now enjoy all the privileges, responsibilities, and inheritance rights of Gods children.

God is the Father of all people in a general sense because he created them (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 17:2428&lt;/strong&gt;). But only those are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ are Gods true spiritual children and in the family of God.

&lt;strong&gt;3.27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12.13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There is an old hymn taken from verse 27 that is sung at every Orthodox church baptismal services to this day.

Water Baptism itself does not secure our union with Christ; it portrays outwardly and visibly the union secured by faith inwardly. Believers in Christ are water baptized; you do not get water baptized to become a believer in Jesus Christ.

Water baptism is a declaration of a real and living union with Jesus Christ and the command to be water baptized is given to &lt;strong&gt;every one of you.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. &lt;/strong&gt;

In the new creation, the distinction between Jew and Gentile is removed (&lt;strong&gt; 2:1122&lt;/strong&gt;). Christians are incorporated into a community of believers in which each member has put on a kind of clothing that covers differences that normally divide people, such as gender, ethnicity, and social status.

Unity in Christ transcends ethnic, social and gender distinctions. In grace, there is no race.

But it is important for us to understand that equality and unity in Christ &lt;em&gt;does not mean that God has abolished different roles of authority&lt;/em&gt;.

In Christ there are distinctive roles in the workplace, the home and the church for functional purposes and order.

It means that in Christ, authority that is governed by the love, grace and Spirit of Christ has replaced mean spirited, heavy-handed authority or attitudes of spiritual superiority.

&lt;strong&gt;3.29 And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise&lt;/strong&gt;

All believers, Jew and Gentile, are heirs of the spiritual blessing that accompanied the Abrahamic Covenantjustification by faith (&lt;strong&gt; 15:6; cf. Rom. 4:311&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those who are in Christ Jesus&lt;/span&gt;

Jesus Christ has bought us with the price of His own death, which means that we now doubly belong to God.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As our Creator He made you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As our Redeemer, He bought you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
This means, beloved, that your life is no longer your own to do with as you please, but to live for Christ and to do what pleases Him. How far do we take this living for Christ?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James 4.13-17 Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit; whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. Instead you ought to say, &lt;em&gt;If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that&lt;/em&gt;. But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 10.31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And the singular purpose for our lives now is to magnify Christ and bring Him glory in whatever situation we are in. The cross of Jesus Christ nails selfish living into a coffin.

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those who are undecided or unsure of the salvation of their soul. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 John 2.1,2 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Advocate- &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word is parakletos, a "&lt;em&gt;helper&lt;/em&gt;," such as an attorney in a legal matter. Jesus Christ is our Defense Attorney before The Father.

&lt;strong&gt;Propitiation-&lt;/strong&gt; A propitiation is a sacrifice presented to God that is meant to take away the enmity that is brought on by sin between God and the worshiper.

A propitiation is &lt;em&gt;a sacrifice that bears Gods wrath and turns it to favor&lt;/em&gt;. Only The Lord Jesus Christ can be an effective propitiation for sinners who call upon His Name.

By dying on the cross, Christ bore Gods wrath for all who trust in Him, anywhere in the world, giving us the ultimate example of love (1 John 4:10).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 3.24-26 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 John 4.10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
By means of the atoning death of Christ, God in His great love for us has appeased the wrath of God on account of sin.

Thus, to the sinner who repents of their sin and believes in Jesus Christ, God provides a covering for their sin and gives unto them newness of life.

&lt;strong&gt;Repent and be baptized every one of you in The Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin, and you shall receive the gift of The Holy Ghost.&lt;/strong&gt;

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>By the fourth chapter of Galatians, the main thesis of the Epistle has been established. Paul has shown that the Gentile Christians are in the true Abrahamic succession of faith. Jesus Christ was the heir of Abrahams testament; He was the fulfillment of all of the ceremonial types and shadows of the law. He perfectly obeyed the demands of the law. And now, those who are in Christ have escaped, by the grace of God, the curse and condemnation of the Law. The remainder of the Apostles argument, down to &lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/index.cgi?q1=Galatians+5:12&amp;amp;t1=en_nas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5:12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; is devoted to the illustration and application of this position.

This next section of Galatians teaches the doctrine of &lt;strong&gt;adoption. &lt;/strong&gt;Adoption does not have the same meaning here as it does in our thinking. In our culture, a couple sees a lovely little child in an orphanage and takes legal steps to make the child their own. The adoption process here follows the customs and practices of Roman society in the first century A.D.

You have to go back to chapter three to catch up to speed with the thought that Paul is developing here. He has already established the fact that we are children of God by our faith in Christ Jesus.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3.27,29&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For as many of you have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;And if you are Christs, then are you Abrahams seed. And you are heirs according to the promise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gal. 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.&lt;/strong&gt;

The word for child here in Greek is a reference to an infant or a very young child. In the Roman culture, and in our culture as well, if a father dies and leaves great wealth for his little son or daughter, that child is not much better off than a slave until he grows up. Because even though he actually owns everything his father had, they would still be under the control of these &lt;strong&gt;tutors and governors&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;until &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;time appointed of the father.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Time appointed of the father&lt;/strong&gt; is an important phrase. This points to the day when the boy becomes a full-grown adult with all the legal rights and privileges, no longer under the control of others.What Paul is saying to those who are insisting that we are obligated to keep the law to be saved is this. Now that Christ as come, we are no longer under the temporary schoolmaster of religion or Judaism.We now relate to God on a whole new basis. And that basis is by His grace, through our faith in the risen, exalted Lord Jesus Christ. The Christian's righteousness is not because of our works, nor because of our keeping the law. The Christian's righteousness is the gift from God and is a righteousness that is imputed to me by my faith in Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 4.5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. &lt;/strong&gt;

An&lt;strong&gt; element &lt;/strong&gt;in Greek is a word that refers to the elementary or basic principles of something. For example, we would liken it to the first elements of grammar, like the A B C of children. Here it refers to the worldly or "outward" forms of religious observances.Very simply, the elements of the world refer to all the things that fallen man observes to get right with God and to secure the favor and approval of God.

Both the Jewish and Gentile world were bound by religious rituals and outward observances like going to priests as mediators, sacred temples or buildings and holy altars for sacrifices to appease God.Before Christ came into their lives, the Jews were slaves to Jewish laws and rituals, for they thought that by observing them, they could be saved. They were being mastered by outward observance of rituals, but they did not have a personal, heart relationship with God, because they were &lt;strong&gt;in bondage under the elements of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 15.7-9 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But when the fullness of time came - &lt;/strong&gt;The phrase &lt;strong&gt;fulness of time &lt;/strong&gt;refers to &lt;em&gt;the time determined by God&lt;/em&gt;. God in the Old Testament laid out the whole redemptive program. When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden, God said that The Seed of the woman (&lt;em&gt;Speaking of the Incarnation of The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;) would bruise the serpents head. (&lt;strong&gt; 7:14; Matt. 1:20-25&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Thus, the importance of the doctrine of the virgin birth.&lt;/em&gt;

The phrase &lt;strong&gt;sent forth His Son&lt;/strong&gt; presumes the preexistent state of Jesus. At the exact time predetermined by God the Father, He sent forth God the Son, born of a woman, born under the Law.

&lt;strong&gt;Born Of a Woman&lt;/strong&gt; - This points out that not only is Jesus God eternally, but that He also fully took upon Himself the form of man. &lt;strong&gt;Phil 2.5-8&lt;/strong&gt; tells of this incredible emptying of the deity of Jesus into not only the form of humanity, but also the form of a servant.

&lt;strong&gt;Born Under the Law&lt;/strong&gt; - This refers to Jesus being born as a Jew and therefore under the law of Moses. However, what is unique about Jesus' relationship with the law is that because He was sinless, He perfectly fulfilled the law. Because He perfectly obeyed and had no sin debt of His own to atone for, Jesus was able to pay the debt of our sins as a substitute.

The word &lt;strong&gt;redeem &lt;/strong&gt; means, "&lt;em&gt;to buy up&lt;/em&gt;." The concept of redemption comes from the institution of slavery. &lt;em&gt;The price of our redemption was paid by the Father in the blood of His Son&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(1 Peter 1:18; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Heb. 9:12&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;em&gt;and by the Son in giving His life as a ransom for many &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Mt 20:28&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Rom. 3:24; 1 Cor. 1:30) &lt;/strong&gt;

Now that we are born again, we are adopted sons of God. As adopted sons of God, we are no longer lorded over by a religious system, but by our wonderful Lord Jesus Christ. Religion and legalism are the spirit of bondage.&lt;strong&gt; Whom The Son sets free is free indeed.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.&lt;/strong&gt;

As we saw in chapter 3, Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law in order that those who place our trust and faith in Him might receive the adoption of sons.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 1.11 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; to them that believe on His Name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Abba&lt;/strong&gt; is an intimate word that denotes the close and dear relationship between a child of God and the Father. This relationship with God is all because of the grace of God, not human accomplishment.This crying &lt;strong&gt;Abba Father &lt;/strong&gt;is the inner witness of The Holy Spirit that confirms that we have truly been born of God by the Spirit of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7 Wherefore thou art no more &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul concludes this illustration by declaring that through Jesus Christ, we are no longer under the control of the law or any religious system, but into the inheritance of all that is given to a mature son.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:8 Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;No gods- &lt;/strong&gt;Paul is referring here to religious idols as vanities  nothings that people who do not know Jesus Christ look to for help.

The Roman Empire had a broad range of "gods" to choose from. Some believed that the sun, moon and stars were to be worshiped. Some called upon departed loved ones who had crossed over to the other side to put in a good word to God for them. Others worshiped aspects of nature like rivers, while others worshiped a pantheon of gods that had grown out of ancient myths.

Though the gods they gave homage to were not in fact gods, they nonetheless were in bondage to them. They prayed to them, they sought to please them; they performed rituals in order to worship these "gods." There are demonic powers behind false gods and false religious systems that blind people from the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:9 But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 10 Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 11 I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul is amazed that they were &lt;strong&gt;so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;How turn ye again- &lt;/strong&gt;Like in the book of Hebrews, they were turning their backs on Christ and getting involved in religious &lt;strong&gt;elements&lt;/strong&gt; of ceremonies and legalism again.

He reminds them that these ceremonies or rituals are "&lt;strong&gt;weak&lt;/strong&gt;" because they are powerless in saving a person from the power of sin and the judgment that sin deserves. They are "&lt;strong&gt;beggarly&lt;/strong&gt;" because they are incapable of providing the spiritual riches that are available in the provisions of the gospel of the grace of God in Christ. &lt;strong&gt;We, through His poverty have become rich.&lt;/strong&gt;

They were &lt;strong&gt;observing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;days, and months, and times, and years. &lt;/strong&gt; - A person who is being taught to put faith in special "holy days" &lt;em&gt;as the way to eternal life&lt;/em&gt; is being seduced by a lying spirit and doctrine of demons.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Col 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Col 2.16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; of Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul appeals to these wavering saints as brethren. When he says to them &lt;strong&gt;be as I am, &lt;/strong&gt;he is saying to them, dont forsake the grace of God for the law. When Paul came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, he laid aside the legalism and bondage of Judaism and was clothed with the righteousness, grace and riches of Jesus Christ. (&lt;strong&gt;Phil 3.4-8&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4.13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. 14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;

God allowed Paul to be afflicted physically, &lt;em&gt;not because he didnt have enough faith to claim his healing as the faith heretics teach&lt;/em&gt;, but to make the gospel known in the area of Galatia. Due to this illness, some say it may have been an acute case of malaria, or ophthalmia, which is an Oriental eye disease, Paul was detained in this area for a while, during which time he preached the gospel of the grace of God.

Paul talks more about his personal weaknesses and how God used them in his life in &lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 12:7-9&lt;/strong&gt;.

Pauls physical trial was a temptation to them that may have caused them to act with indifference towards him. But in spite of Pauls repulsive appearance, they received him with great kindness. They treated Paul as a messenger of heaven.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4.15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul uses very graphic language to describe their love for him. But he is now lamenting because of how these legalists had poisoned their minds towards him.

&lt;strong&gt;16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?&lt;/strong&gt;

The words &lt;strong&gt;your enemy &lt;/strong&gt;implies that Paul had gone from being loved by them to being their enemy. Why? Because he was telling them the truth about salvation by grace alone, through faith alone in Christ alone apart from works, lest any man should boast.

He told them the truth about the futility of trying to be saved by following man made traditions, keeping the law and jumping through all kinds of man-made religious hoops. The message of grace demolished years of tradition, and it hit the legalists hard in their heart.

&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4.17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.&lt;/strong&gt;

These legalists were going out of their way to court these Galatians. But their zeal was a twisted zeal, not a godly one. Much like the twisted zeal of the Jehovah's Witness and Mormons, who preach another Jesus and proclaim a gospel of salvation by works.It was this type of zeal that was condemned by Jesus Himself.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt 23. 15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gal 4. 18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. 19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, 20 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. &lt;/strong&gt;

Pauls righteous anger in this epistle (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 1:6, Gal 1:9; Gal 3:1; Gal 5:12&lt;/strong&gt;) reflects not only the seriousness with which God regards the task of &lt;strong&gt;contending for the faith once delivered unto the saints&lt;/strong&gt; and preserving the truth of the gospel; but also the love which he had for his "children" in Christ.

His desire (&lt;em&gt;as should be the desire of every legitimate pastor&lt;/em&gt;) was that the flock of God would love Jesus and that Christ would be formed in them.

The Greek word for &lt;strong&gt;formed &lt;/strong&gt;means an outward expression to ones inward nature. &lt;em&gt;Paul wanted Christ to be seen in the lives of the Galatians&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.29 For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Note this beloved, when The Lordship of Christ is on the inside, the fruit of The Living Christ will be manifest on the outside.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 1.7-10 ye were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;they were witnesses of the truth of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to Godward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;they were evangelical; they spread the gospel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fruit of repentance and using their God given talents to serve The Lord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;they were occupying, looking for the return of Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Closing comments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2.9 &lt;/strong&gt;Jesus Christ was &lt;strong&gt;crowned with glory and honour; that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ, in His wonderful love, kept the Law and fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law in order that sinners might be set free from forms of godliness and, solely by His grace, enter into a meaningful relationship with God through faith in His one sacrifice for sin forever.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2.18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul mentioned that Jesus &lt;strong&gt;came at the appointed time&lt;/strong&gt;. There are divine appointments spoken of in Scripture. There is that appointed time of judgment for this earth called &lt;strong&gt;the great tribulation&lt;/strong&gt;; there is for each and every one of us here today &lt;strong&gt;an appointed time to die. &lt;/strong&gt;Are you prepared to step into eternity today? Have you trusted in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ as full payment for your sin debt? Are you repenting of a life of sin and embracing Him as Lord of your life?

My reason and purpose for living under grace and under the gospel, is a far more glorious and rewarding purpose than to live under the law or for a religious system. Under the law or some religious system, you are disposed to do just what is required and thats it.

But under the gospel of grace there is no stopping. The God given awareness of the truth of the gospel and the depth of Gods grace and love for you causes you to delight to do the work and the will of the Lord.

My works and labors as a Christian are the expression of my extreme appreciation for what God has done for me through His Son. By grace, He has brought me into His family, He has adopted me as His son, He has made me the beneficiary of His riches.

As a result of the freeness of Gods grace in my life, it is now the love of Christ constrains me (&lt;strong&gt;2 Cor. 5:14&lt;/strong&gt;)! Im driven by the love of Christ! Im pushed to live the way that I live by this glorious love of Jesus Christ!

It is so sad to see the people of God talking about how much they have done for God and all that they have sacrificed for Him. Really? I am crucified with Christ.

This church family does not exist to make much about us. We exist to make much about Jesus Christ.

Church family, we do not preach the gospel because we have to, but because we love Jesus Christ.

We do not serve here at the church because we have to, but because we love Jesus Christ.

We do not love one another, serve one another and reach out to one another because we have to, but because we love Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 3.17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 3.23,24 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We do what we do church family because we love Jesus and are living for Him! My life is His! And when you count the sacrifice that Jesus made for you, you no longer fill out a serving Jesus time card.

You no longer give to God 10% as a tip for being a good God this week.

You no longer count anything that you do or give as a hardship, but as an honor.

You count it all joy because you are no longer the servant of men, but of God.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Gal 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.&lt;/strong&gt;

After having told theGalatiansin &lt;strong&gt;chapter 4.21-31&lt;/strong&gt; that they are the children of the free woman, Paul now reminds them that they ought not take lightly this precious liberty or freedom that God has given unto us in Christ.

The liberty of which Paul speaks in context is freedom from the rite of circumcision and ceremonies of the law. The observance of those rituals was a &lt;strong&gt;yoke of bondage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;because the false apostles who deemed them as being necessary for salvation were demanding it&lt;/em&gt;.

This &lt;strong&gt;yoke of bondage&lt;/strong&gt; was the meaning for the leadership summit in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 15. &lt;/strong&gt;What was the conclusion of that meeting that was seeking to place the Gentiles under the yoke of the law?&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acts 15:10,11 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This &lt;strong&gt;yoke of bondage &lt;/strong&gt;and ceremonialism reminds us of the time when Jesus was reprimanding the Pharisees and He said to them &lt;strong&gt;you place heavy yokes upon men that neither you will try and carry yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.

This &lt;strong&gt;yoke of bondage&lt;/strong&gt; can just as easily refer to any religious system today that insists that a person is required to perform a set of number of rituals or ordinances in order to enter into fellowship with God.

&lt;strong&gt;Stand fast. &lt;/strong&gt;Put your cleats of the armor of God into the ground and cling to the all-sufficient righteousness of God in Christ. Paul was not getting worked up about the splitting of theological hairs on extraneous issues. The all-sufficient atonement of Jesus Christ and the gospel of grace were at stake.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil 1.27Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5.2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;

Pauls objection here is not to &lt;strong&gt;circumcision&lt;/strong&gt; in itself. Like all Jewish boys, he himself had been circumcised as an infant (&lt;strong&gt; 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;). He did not object to a Christians being circumcised if, as in the case of Timothy (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 16:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;), the act would open doors for ministry.

Pauls warning about &lt;strong&gt;circumcision&lt;/strong&gt; pertained only to the false idea that in itself it carried spiritual benefit or merit. Remember that &lt;em&gt;the Judaizers were saying that faith in Jesus Christ, although important, was not sufficient for complete salvation.&lt;/em&gt;

Note here how strongly Paul &lt;strong&gt;stands fast &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;contends for the faith once delivered unto the saints. &lt;/strong&gt;Paul stands firm on the all-sufficient work of Christ on the cross for our sins. If a person seeks to add anything to the cross, Christs work on the cross for them is of no value at all. This is the dilemma of any person who is a part of any works based cult or religious system.

&lt;strong&gt;5.3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.&lt;/strong&gt;

Please observe beloved that the smallest part of justification cannot be attributed to the law &lt;em&gt;without renouncing Christ and His grace&lt;/em&gt;. Seeking to gain Gods favor by a combination of observing the law &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;receiving it by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ are mutually exclusive.

&lt;em&gt;Christ supplemented is Christ supplanted. &lt;/em&gt;

As we have said previously, if you seek to put yourself in right standing with God by keeping the law, you are indebted to keeping the entire law with no room for error.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For if a man "keeps the whole law, yet he offends in one point, he is guilty of all." (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jas&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=10#s=1148010"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James 2:10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Cursed is the man that continues not in the whole law to do that which is written therein." (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gal&amp;amp;c=3&amp;amp;v=10#s=1094010"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3:10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you are caught speeding and the officer writes you out a ticket, you cannot plead your innocence because you have not robbed a bank or sold drugs. Regardless of how many good things you may have done, in breaking the speed limit you have broken the law.

To seek to earn or merit forgiveness of your sin based upon your efforts divorces you from the saving grace of God, because the gospel of the grace of God can never be mixed with human effort or works.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 11.6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5.5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.&lt;/strong&gt;

Apart from the regenerating work of God, by grace, through faith in the finished work of The Lord Jesus Christ, any ritual is worthless, be it circumcision, water baptism or communion. Without a regenerated, circumcised heart, even valid biblical expressions of faith such as baptism or communion are merely &lt;strong&gt;forms of godliness without the power thereof&lt;/strong&gt;.

The circumcision that relates the New Covenant is:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 2.11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 2.29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6.15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When God does that work of circumcision in a person's life, it brings for a &lt;strong&gt;faith &lt;/strong&gt;that &lt;strong&gt;worketh by love. &lt;/strong&gt;Saving &lt;strong&gt;faith worketh by love!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Beloved, faith without works and faith without love is dead&lt;/em&gt;. That is the message of &lt;strong&gt;1 John &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;James 2. &lt;/strong&gt;Faith and love are verbs. They are visible. &lt;em&gt;A genuine faith in Jesus is a life that is a poured out life, not a poor me life.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A living faith is going to be shown by works of love.&lt;/em&gt; We will be serving one another. Helping one another when in need. Caring for one another. &lt;em&gt;When God is our portion then we are truly free to serve one another through love because we will not be looking to others to satisfy the longings on my soul that only Jesus can fill. &lt;/em&gt;

Remember what Jesus said to the woman who had 5 husbands and was presently living with another man/
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 4.13-15 Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In other words, I will satisfy you and make you whole.

&lt;strong&gt;5.7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 5.8 This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3.3 Having begun in the Spirit are you going to be made perfect in the flesh?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In some margins, there is the translation, &lt;em&gt;Who cut in front of you&lt;/em&gt;? Paul is drawing an illustration from the equivalent to the Olympic games of the day. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You were running well, but someone has cut into your lane and caused you to stumble.

Paul is discerning enough to see through all of the spiritual and religious deception of the Judaizers. He knows that it wasnt The Holy Spirit that was laying this legalistic works trip on them.

&lt;em&gt;Any persuasion to follow a pattern of works or rituals for salvation comes from religious legalists not from The Living God.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul now shifts his analogy from sports to cooking. Leaven in Scripture is by and large with few exceptions, a symbol for evil.

Legalism is leaven, because the leaven of legalism will corrupt, spread and eventually destroy the beauty and freedom of the love and grace of God.

Legalism will eventually produce one of two things: &lt;em&gt;self-glorification or self condemnation&lt;/em&gt;, neither come from the inner working of The Holy Spirit in the life of the believer.

Whenever you mix Jesus with any ism, the ism becomes the focus or measuring stick of orthodoxy and Jesus eventually becomes background music.

The key to deliverance out of any ism is &lt;strong&gt;**Malachi 3.7 Return unto Me. &lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus told the busy church at Ephesus that they had left their first love. The escape from any ism is return to your first love, Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;5.10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.&lt;/strong&gt;

Please underscore the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; part of this verse saints. When someone lays a religious guilt trip on you that says that the grace of God must be earned or merited by being circumcised or keeping any other religious ritual, that person is in deep trouble spiritually before The Lord.

Jesus said, **&lt;strong&gt;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him that a heavy millstone be hung around his neck, and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea (Matt. 18:6).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.11 And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Judaizers, had evidently spread the rumor in Galatia that Paul himself had preached the need of circumcision for salvation. They had taken the fact that (1) Paul himself was circumcised, (2) Paul did not preach against circumcision as a cultural identification among Jews, and (3) he had gone to the trouble of having Timothy, who was from the Galatian region, circumcised. Now they took these facts and distorted them into a Pauline promotion of circumcision for justification.

But Paul tells us that he was being persecuted because the gospel of Jesus Christ is offensive.

The great offense of the cross to the Jews was that Christ &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;the final sacrifice for sin forever, and because of His atonement, the whole Jewish system of sacrifices for sin and ordinances perished at the cross. The entire book of Galatians and Hebrews states this truth very clearly.

The great offense of the cross to fallen man is because it refutes the notion that all men are good by nature. The Bible says in &lt;strong&gt;Romans 3.10;23 there is none righteous, no not one. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

The great offense of the cross is that according to Scripture, the only way to get to the Father is through the only One Mediator between sinners and a holy God is His Son, Jesus Christ.

Paul writes in &lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 2.5,6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.&lt;/strong&gt;

The cross of Jesus Christ is offensive to those who say that we need to accept all religions because all roads lead to heaven. No, they dont! The Bible says that in&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 7.13,14 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.&lt;/strong&gt;

Scripture says that there is one way that leads to heaven. Jesus said **&lt;strong&gt;John 14:6 I am the way, the truth and the life. And no man comes to the Father, but by Me.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 I would they were even cut off which trouble you.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul severely condemns the false teachers who were hindering (v. 7), persuading (v. 8), and troubling (vv. 10, 12) the Galatians

The cult of Cybele was a popular pagan nature goddess in Asia Minor during Pauls day. Many devout male worshipers in the cult castrated themselves, and all its priests were self-made eunuchs. Verse 11 is some of the harshest words of Paul to those who were reinterpreting the true meaning of the gospel of the grace of God.

&lt;strong&gt;5.13-15 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Apostle tells us, &lt;strong&gt;you were called to liberty (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;But this liberty that we have been called to isnt a liberty to believe whatever I want to believe and live however I want to live.

I cannot create a Jesus of my own imagination Who is lesser than how He is revealed in Scripture as Lord and God. I cannot create a Jesus of my own imagination Who allows me to live however I want with no moral responsibility or restraints at all.

Doctrinally, Christian liberty can only be received by grace through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. Practically, Christian liberty is expressed by a love for God and others.

&lt;strong&gt;Occasion to the flesh&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever we take our eyes off of the cross of Jesus Christ, and His command to &lt;strong&gt;serve one another in love, &lt;/strong&gt;we will inevitably give occasion to our flesh. The liberty that we have in Christ is the freedom to &lt;strong&gt;serve one another in love. &lt;/strong&gt;Liberty and joy is found in serving, not in being served.

Paul says that we fulfill the law of God when we live in love (&lt;strong&gt; 13:8-10&lt;/strong&gt;). One of the lawyers challenged Jesus as to the greatest commandment. And Jesus said, "&lt;strong&gt;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind and with all thy strength; and thy neighbor as thyself. And in these are all the law and the prophets" (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Mat&amp;amp;c=22&amp;amp;v=37#s=951037"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 22:37-40&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

To &lt;strong&gt;love your neighbor as yourself&lt;/strong&gt; is not a command to love yourself first. &lt;em&gt;It is a command to take your natural, already existing love of self and make it the measuring rod of your love for others.&lt;/em&gt; This means that we will be as eager and willing to do good things for others as we are in doing good things for ourself.

It means that we will care about what happens to others as much as you care about what happens to ourself. Can you imagine what your marriage would be like if you lived like that? Can you imagine what this church would be like if we all lived like that?

Beloved, when I am being filled and satisfied with the unselfish love of Jesus Christ for me, the overflow of that love is going to be His love flowing in me and through me towards others.

When Jesus Christ is our first love and the source of our personal satisfaction and fulfillment, it sets us free from being dependent on the church or other people to fill that emptiness. A person who is experiencing the love of God in their life is going to be a person that is expressing the love of God towards others.

In Christ, we are now free, by the Spirits power, to walk in newness of life. We are free to love The Lord and serve one other sacrificially.

Through faith in Christ, we have been set free from a life of selfishness. The opposite of love is not hate, but selfishness. &lt;em&gt;Any man who is all wrapped up in himself makes a small parcel. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;But if ye bite and devour one another. &lt;/strong&gt;The idea here is that of wild animals ruthlessly attacking and slaughtering each other. Not exactly the description of sheep, is it? More like wolves.

&lt;em&gt;What &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;do wild animals do when they are starving and empty?&lt;/em&gt; They go on the attack and devour others. What do you and I do when we are sensing that gaping hole of empty inside because we have taken our eyes off the cross and are not being personally satisfied by the fullness of the love of God? We will bite, criticize, accuse and devour others who are not meeting our needs.

And what organ in our body do we use to bite and devour? Your kidney? Your spleen? The answer? Your tongue on the phone or your fingers on email, FaceBook or Twitter.

&lt;em&gt;Beloved, when the message of the cross of Jesus Christ is void of the application of our divine responsibility to love one another as Jesus has loved us, we will be like a selfish pack of dogs, biting and devouring one another with our words, our attitudes and our actions. &lt;/em&gt;

May each one of us purpose in our hearts to love Jesus supremely and love one another, kindly and tenderly. Be a sheep, not a ravening dog.

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;An appeal to the unsaved&lt;/span&gt;

Because the gospel is fixed only upon Jesus Christ and His cross, most people are offended over the exclusivity of the gospel message. Fallen man cannot believe that all of their religious observances or good works or acts of humanitarian service fail to make them right before God.

Are you among those who believe that God is going to make an &lt;em&gt;exception&lt;/em&gt; in your case?

My friend, the unchanging God and His unchanging gospel is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.

My friend, you and I can't do anything to buy or earn our redemption or the forgiveness of our sin. The price of your redemption and the forgiveness of your sins are the gift of God, by grace, through faith in death, burial and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 22.17 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecclesiastes 3.11 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The city of Corinth, like most metropolitan cities today, prided themselves in their universities and philosophies. They were extremely educated, but they were hedonistic and sexually tolerant and promiscuous.

They were a very open-minded society that prided themselves in their openness to all religions. It was in this climate that prided themselves in their brilliant orators, worldly philosophy, sexual and religious open-mindedness that Paul was sent by Christ to preach the gospel. Oh, the love and mercy that God has for sinners!

&lt;strong&gt;18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul came to intellectual, polytheistic, morally loose Corinth with a simple, but powerful message, the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Paul reminds us that there are two divisions of mankind--the unsaved and the saved; it literally reads &lt;em&gt;those who are perishing &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; those who are being saved.&lt;/em&gt;

To those who are perishing, the cross is foolishness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 2.14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for or they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acts 17.18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To those who are saved, the cross of Jesus Christ, the slain Lamb of God, it is the power of God unto salvation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Only the gospel of Jesus Christ contains &lt;strong&gt;the power of God &lt;/strong&gt;that is able to deliver sinners from all the debt of sin, the power of sin, the guilt of sin and the pollution of sin.

What is the answer to mans social, racial and immorality problems? Well, to answer that question, we first need to realize that &lt;em&gt;each one of those problems stems from sin&lt;/em&gt;, and thus the only answer to mans problems is the cross of Jesus Christ.

That is why what has come to be known as The Great Commission, Jesus told us to &lt;strong&gt;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16.15&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;When the church becomes more cause focused than Christ and gospel focused, we have lost our way, and will inevitable become another social or political wing of society.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. (Isa 29:14)&lt;/strong&gt;

By turning to the passage in Isaiah, we learn that God does not save a mans soul by using the wisdom and understanding of men; He saves mens soul from damnation through the preaching of the cross.

The preaching of the cross is wiser and more powerful than the wisdom and ability of man, because neither worldly wisdom nor fleshly wisdom is able to save a person &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; sins debt or deliver them from sins power.

Let me give you a couple of examples. A person can have the human wisdom and brilliance to build a spacecraft to put a man on the moon, and yet not have the strength to resist being addicted to gambling or immorality or covetousness.

&lt;strong&gt;20 Where is the wise (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Greek, the term "philosopher" means a lover of wisdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)? where is the scribe (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Jewish learned class&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.&lt;/strong&gt;

These passages are filled with intense irony. Those who are wise according to the standards of the world think the gospel is foolish. &lt;em&gt;But even the most "foolish" thing about God is wiser than human wisdom&lt;/em&gt; (vv. 25, 27).

God uses the simplicity of the gospel to demonstrate that real foolishness belongs to those who oppose Him (v. 27). Please keep in mind that Paul is not belittling a good education or philosophy, or wisdom or scholarship. &lt;em&gt;He is speaking against those who were using the mind that God gave them to argue against the God Who created them&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;with that brilliant mind in the first place. &lt;/em&gt;

The devil capitalizes on the arrogance of human wisdom to keep them blinded from the truth of the gospel.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 4:3,4 But even if our gospel is hid, it is hid to those who are lost, in whom whose the god of this world hath blinded, the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, Who is the image of God should shine unto them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The world through its own wisdom can never come to the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God must come from a wisdom that is outside of the libraries, and universities and philosophies of this fallen world system.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 16.15-17 But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father which is in heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus thanked the Father for His good pleasure in hiding these things from the wise and learned but revealing them to little children.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11.25,26 I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Interestingly, Jesus makes one of the most oft quoted invitations to sinners after this statement of the revealing work of God in drawing sinners to Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11.28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Come to Me. Take from Me. Learn of Me. &lt;/em&gt;That is the sum of the Christian life.

&lt;strong&gt;22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Jews&lt;/strong&gt; asked for a sign from heaven, &lt;em&gt;not merely miracles&lt;/em&gt;, such as Jesus and the apostles worked&lt;strong&gt; (Ac 4:22; 6:8; 8:6; 15:12; 19:11), &lt;/strong&gt;but a sign from heaven&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

What was Jesus answer to the Jews who demanded a sign from Him?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 12.38-40 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Greeks&lt;/strong&gt; demanded a well-argued system of philosophy. As I said earlier, In &lt;strong&gt;Acts&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;18, &lt;/strong&gt;the Epicureans and Stoics called Paul a babbler (&lt;em&gt;seed picker&lt;/em&gt;), because he preached the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;We preach Christ crucified- &lt;/strong&gt;Not merely Christ, as is preached by the new age movement or other world religions, but Christ Crucified. The Crucified Savior Who died on the cross for our sins.

All the world religions preach a Christ, but not &lt;em&gt;the Christ&lt;/em&gt; of Scripture. They do not preach &lt;em&gt;the Christ&lt;/em&gt; Who redeems man from their sin. The do not preach &lt;em&gt;the Christ&lt;/em&gt; Who is The Only Door into heaven. They do not preach &lt;em&gt;the Christ Who is Emmanuel, God with us.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;We preach Christ unto the Jews a stumbling-block&lt;/strong&gt;.

Jesus was a stumbling block to the Jews because they had an entirely different conception of the Christ. It may seem strange, but even with &lt;strong&gt;53, Psalm 22&lt;/strong&gt; and many other Scriptures before their eyes, the Jews were no longer looking for a Messiah that would be crucified for their sin, but a political, military Messiah who would give them the kingdom now!

Yet it was predicted that Jesus would be "&lt;strong&gt;a stone of stumbling&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 8.14 And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
That God would take on flesh and die for the guilty was the height of absurdity to the Jews. The very thought that the Messiah (Gods anointed) had been hanged on a tree and had come under the divine curse (&lt;strong&gt;Gal 3:13; Dt 21:23&lt;/strong&gt;) was intolerable to many Jews.

&lt;strong&gt;We preach Christ unto the Greeks foolishness. &lt;/strong&gt;

According to Greek philosophers, a God who suffered was a contradiction in terms. How can you believe that somebody dying on a cross can be God? The very idea of incarnation, of God becoming a man, was revolting to the Greek mind.

Jesus is still a stumbling block to fallen man people today because it was Jesus Who said &lt;strong&gt;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God (John 3.3-7). &lt;/strong&gt;They stumble at Jesus because it was Jesus Who said, &lt;strong&gt;except ye repent, you shall likewise perish (Luke 13.3,4). &lt;/strong&gt;They stumble at Jesus because it was Jesus Who said, &lt;strong&gt;except you deny yourself and pick up your cross daily, you cannot be My disciple (Luke 9.23).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.&lt;/strong&gt;

It is interesting that the Greek word for the English word "called" here speaks of both being invited and being appointed.

The knowledge of Jesus Christ exceeds all the wisdom in the universe. What looks like foolishness to the world is actually Gods wisdom; what looks like weakness to the world is actually Gods power.

The greatest demonstration of this truth is the cross of Jesus on Mount Calvary.

&lt;strong&gt;26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;note that he didnt say, not any&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 28 And base things of the world (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;those of lowly birth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and things which are despised (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;who the world calls nobodies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;philosophy of men and man made religious systems of high repute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;

God uses common people, ordinary people like you and I to work in His kingdom. We do well to look at our calling unto salvation because it magnifies the grace of God in saving sinners.

The Gospel call to salvation is to be given to &lt;em&gt;all classes of men&lt;/em&gt;; but in many cases the wise, the educated, the mighty, or the well to do, are often too busy &lt;em&gt;making a living&lt;/em&gt;, or far too smart or too self righteous to think that &lt;em&gt;they &lt;/em&gt;need the grace of Jesus Christ to be saved in the same way that the most rank criminal in the world does.

A simple, uneducated, untalented, and clumsy believer who has trusted in Jesus Christ as Savior and who faithfully and humbly follows His Lord is immeasurably wiser than the brilliant professor or doctor who scoffs at the gospel and knows nothing beyond his books, his own mind, and his own experience.

&lt;strong&gt;29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.&lt;/strong&gt;

Pride is self-deification. What you and I need is an &lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 6&lt;/strong&gt; experience with The Lord. We need a &lt;em&gt;Woe is me&lt;/em&gt; encounter with Jesus.

Blessed are the poor in spirit, not the proud in spirit.

&lt;strong&gt;30 But of him (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the free grace of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) are ye in Christ Jesus (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;united to him by faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus- &lt;/strong&gt;It is The Father that unites sinners to Christ by His call.

&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom- &lt;/strong&gt;Jesus is wisdom. &lt;strong&gt;**Colossians 2.3 In Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt;

It is only in following Jesus that we walk in wisdom; and, it is only in listening to Jesus that we hear the knowledge that we need.

&lt;strong&gt;He is righteousness&lt;/strong&gt;. In the writings of Paul, righteousness means to be in right standing with God. When God calls Jesus Christ our righteousness, a very humbling, corresponding idea must be understood  &lt;em&gt;that in us there is nothing but sin and unrighteousness&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Sanctification-&lt;/strong&gt; This means to be set apart for The Masters use; consecrated, devoted.

&lt;strong&gt;Redemption- &lt;/strong&gt;Christ Jesus became our redemption, which means that He paid the penalty for our sins on the cross and released us from our slavery to sin.

Our redemption is past (&lt;em&gt;justification;&lt;/em&gt; freed from sins debt), present (&lt;em&gt;sanctification&lt;/em&gt;; freed from sins power), and future (&lt;em&gt;glorification; &lt;/em&gt;freed from ever sinning again).

&lt;strong&gt;31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

The message of the cross magnifies the glory of God alone.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 9.23,24 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 10.17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 5.13 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A saved person glories in Jesus Christ alone. We glory in Who He is and in what He has done for us. All glory and honor and praise be unto The Lord Jesus Christ for ever and ever.

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Lords Supper&lt;/span&gt;

The doctrine of salvation by grace, through faith in the crucified Savior Jesus Christ is the one and only gospel that humbles the pride of man and exalts the glory of God foundation of human hope.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2.8,9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Take a moment to consider Gods objective of setting you apart in Christ.

What are the ramifications and implications of that reality for your daily life? Your family life? Your church life?</ns3:encoded>

		<title>1 Galatians 6:11-18</title>

		<ns3:encoded>As we have seen, Paul sent the epistle of Galatians to a church that had been victimized by the leaven of false teaching and legalism. The glorious gospel of the grace of God and the cross of Jesus Christ was being attacked by proponents of a religious system who were saying that faith in Christ alone was not enough to save your soul. They were the orthodox religious teachers who were more concerned about the teachings and traditions of the fathers than the truth of Scripture.

Here at the end of this letter, Paul ends on a personal note with an appeal to return to the cross of Christ and the gospel of His grace. Paul is writing with intense passion here because eternal souls are at stake. Legalism, religion and the gospel of the grace of God cannot coexist; don't believe the bumper stickers, beloved! For a person to be wrong about eternal things when they think they are right is scary stuff, and Paul, under the inspiration of The Holy Ghost, is writing to set the record straight. Not only for the saints under his care, but for those who were lost in their belief of another gospel. He wanted to see them saved.

Paul had a raging thirst and love for Jesus Christ. He had a raging thirst and love for souls. He had a raging thirst and love for the glory of God in His church.Are you here this morning thirsting for God? Is Jesus Christ the supreme love of your life?

This raging thirst and love for Jesus Christ can be summed up in one word:Passion.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Galatians 6:11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Some scholars believe that Pauls writing with large letters by his own hand could be because of deteriorating eyesight that he mentioned in Gal. 4:13-15. Many others believe that Paul chose to write in block letters as opposed to using the cursive of the scribes, because he was emphasizing the content of the message as being extremely important. He tells us that he wrote this letter with his own hand. Many times he dictated the letters that he wrote, but this time he personally wrote it. Thus, I think it is more probable that Paul wrote the letter himself with the same purpose as he used the block letters- to emphasize the importance of the message.

By todays standards, Paul would have been considered legally blind. From other Scriptures we know that Paul was not an eloquent speaker. This teaches me that the only handicap that holds any person in the body of Christ from serving Him in some way, shape or form is never one of ability or eloquence, but a divided heart or an unwilling heart.

Jesus taught us parables on using our God given talents. How are you using your God given talents and gifts for the furtherance of the gospel, the edification of the body of Christ, and above all, for the glory of God? Read the parables again. God accepts no excuses from any of us, none.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul tells us straight up that these false teachers who were attacking the validity of his ministry were preaching circumcision to appease the Jewish authorities and to avoid the inevitable consequence of persecution of preaching salvation through a crucified Christ.

Compromise and tolerance are modern day virtues of a man without any sound convictions of truth. Beloved, if our mindset in preaching the truth of the gospel is affected in any way by the fear of man or the fear of being rejected instead of well thought of, we will eventually cease preaching Christ crucified.

The preaching of Christ crucified jars our human ego and strips us naked of all merit and worthiness before God. The preaching of Christ crucified reveals our utter depravity and our total dependence on the grace and mercy of God alone for salvation.

The love of God comes to us through Christ crucified so that we can see what our sin really looks like and the punishment that we deserve.

The gospel of Jesus Christ makes it morally impossible to feel good or be proud at the foot of the cross. And so for those who don't want to humble themselves before God, the cross remains an offense and a scandal.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These legalists were not interested in preaching the truth, they were only interested in making a proselyte to their traditional brand of religious beliefs handed down to them from their fathers. These Legalists were the religious orthodox of the day. A legalist will always be spending more time criticizing and proselytizing fellow believers to adopt their system of theology or philosophy of Christian living.

Beware of the leaven of legalism beloved, it is more orthodox and alive and well today than you think.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is (Lit. stands) crucified unto me, and I unto the world. {by whom: or, whereby}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To glory in the cross would be equivalent to us saying that we are fond of electric chairs!

Between Paul and the world (this fallen world system) there was a cross. That should be the position of every believer today. Why? Let Scripture interpret Scripture.

1 John 2.15-17 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeis not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.

There is only One love that will conquer our love affair for the fallen and diseased pleasures and lusts of this world, and that one love is Jesus Christ. Jesus is The Bread of Life. Jesus is The Fountain of Living Water. If Jesus is not our first love, our others loves in life will be diseased and disordered.

The cross and nothing else will have more to do with conforming you into the image of Jesus and cause you to bear fruit for the glory of God more than anything else. A person will be devoted to whatever they glory in.

Saving faith to Paul was not a dry, formal intellectual assent to certain biblical truths. As followers of Jesus Christ, we are not called to simply agree that Jesus Christ died for sinners. We are called to actually glory in His cross and let the chips fall where they may. We are called to boast in the mystery and wonder of the cross. We are called to cherish the beauty and benefits of the cross. The cross of Jesus Christ is the pride and joy of our lives.

What else can we glory in beloved, but the cross of Jesus Christ? All that we have and all that we are and all that we look forward to stems from the finished work of Jesus Christ on His cross. The lures of the world had been crucified to Paul in exchange for being crucified with Christ. He counted all loss that He might possess Christ (Philippians 3:7-8). By being crucified to the world, Paul chose rather to be crucified with Christ (2:20).

Hebrews 11.25,26 (Moses) Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward

The cross will interfere with the way that we live in the world. The cross will not allow us to love the world. The cross will not allow us to be conformed to the image of this world. The cross deals a deathblow to our former love affair with the world system. Love not the world is the message of the cross!

Philippians 3:17-19 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.

There are no crown-wearers in heaven who were not cross-bearers here below. - Charles Haddon Spurgeon

Which cross? The old cross slew men; the new cross of todays church entertains them. The old cross destroyed confidence in the flesh; the new cross encourages it and even promotes it. The old cross taught self forgetfulness; the new cross promotes self esteem. The old cross pierced hearts and produced God fearing holiness; the new cross preaches a heady gospel that puffs up the intellectually elite with devilish pride and spiritual snobbery. The old cross produced God fearing prophets who were ridiculed and mocked; the new cross magnifies eloquent speakers and writers who are applauded and esteemed by men. The old cross-focused on gospel based, spiritual transformation and our relationship with God; the new cross focuses on social reform and our relationship with one another.

There are no crown-wearers in heaven who were not cross-bearers here below. - Charles Haddon Spurgeon

There is no such thing as a cross less disciple, because the very essence of discipleship is a matter of taking up ones cross and following Him. (Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Luke 9:23).

We, who preach the gospel, must not think of ourselves as public relations agents sent to establish good will between Christ and the world. We must not imagine ourselves commissioned to make Christ acceptable to big business, the press, or the world of sports, or modern entertainment. We are not diplomats, but prophets; and our message is not a compromise, but an ultimatum. The Biblical Evangelist, November 1, 1991
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul knew the truth of the all sufficiency of Christ. He knew that in the eyes of The Father, he was complete in Christ. 

We could say today that neither religious affiliation or good works counts for anything. A pure legalist and religious person does not believe that God will forgive them or love them through faith in Christ alone, so they attach works or rituals to the cross.

The bottom line this morning is this. Have you been born again? Are you a new creature in Christ Jesus? 

The real issue is whether or not we are a new creation in Christ in the inside. Religion and legalism are outside jobs. Religion and legalism are spiritual corpses with makeup on. The gospel of grace is an "inside the heart" job that is done by God Himself beloved. There is no other message like it in the universe.

2 Corinthians 5.17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

This new creature is the new birth as spoken of by Jesus Christ to Nicodemus. This new creature is described in Titus 3.5,6 as the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.

The question is not is you are a member of a church. The question is this. Are your names written in heaven?

Luke 10.20 Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.

Why is this so important that your names are written in heaven?

Revelation 20.11-15 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.

Those not written in the book of life will be thrown into the lake of fire.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Israel of God may mean: (1) the Gentile church, which through faith has inherited the promise God gave to Abraham ( 3:29 ) or (2) more likely, the remnant of believing Israel chosen by grace ( Rm 11:5 ), as opposed to the false brothers among the Jews ( Gl 7 8 2:4 ), who were seeking to be justified by the works of the law ( 2:16 ).

The Israel of God are those who are governed by God through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. God fills your heart and life with peace and mercy; and these things are due to His gifts of grace and love, not my efforts or righteousness. Like the tax gatherer in the temple, the mercy and peace of God is given to those who simply cry out, God be merciful to me a sinner."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In the times of Paul, the Greek word for marks was used for the brand that identified slaves. He is not talking about the Roman Catholic stigmata. Pauls marks were not from some religious ritual, but from opposition due to his uncompromising commitment to The Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Corinthians 11.23-27 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

Every yielded saint bears marks of following Jesus. *

2 Timothy 3.12 Those who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.The marks of persecution 8 9 may be marks of rejection, marks of loneliness, marks of ridicule and mockery.

Are you and I individuals that are marked for Jesus in our families? At work? School? At the gym?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Grace, Gods favor and love upon you. Grace is getting what we do not deserve. Gods Riches At Christs Expense. Dont frustrate that holy grace by living carnal....dont frustrate that saving grace by rejecting the work of Jesus Christ because of what some religious institution has lied to you about for generation after generation. 

Paul closes this letter as he began it, by calling these people to live their Christian life on the basis of God's undeserved favor and blessing through His Son, Jesus Christ. Beloved, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. Live graciously, love graciously, serve graciously. The importance of preaching the centrality of the cross of Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross of Christ alone redeems from the curse of the law&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross of Christ alone brings reconciliation and justification with God&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross of Christ alone destroys the power of Satan in your life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross of Christ alone unites all believers in Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross of Christ is God's one and only plan for rescuing sinners. those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The cross, not legalism conforms you into the image of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul used to be a religious legalist. He saw legalism clearly because he used to be one. According to Paul, legalism was a message that was more concerned about observing dead traditions than speaking and living out the truth of God daily. Legalism's objective in any century is to conform others to a certain religious mold, philosophy or appearance on the outside, that has absolutely nothing to do with being crucified with Christ or real holiness on the inside.

How does one know if one's name is written in heaven? Like Adam and Eve, some of you came walking in clothed with the fig leaves of religion or self righteousness. You haven't fooled God, but you are fooling yourself. Take off those fig leaves of self righteousness and good works and put on the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

Isa 45:22 Look unto me (nobody else, nothing else), and be ye saved (freed, delivered, defended, rescued), all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. 23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

On the Day of Pentecost, Peter preached the crucified, buried and risen Lord Jesus. He declared: Acts 2.36,37 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.

Please note what happened next. Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Here is the answer.... Acts 2.38 Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

In Acts 16.30, a Roman jailer asked the apostle Paul and Silas this question. Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Their answer? Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

There is no sin so awful that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse. He makes the vilest sinner clean. Nothing-not your worst offense-stands between you and the Cross. . .between you and forgiveness. . .between you and a loving Heavenly Father-nothing but your hesitation. Come to Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>On Paul's second missionary journey, the Spirit of God leads himto plant a church in the middle of "sin city", Corinth. Morally speaking, you could get no lower than in Corinth. Spiritually speaking, you could get no more pagan and superstitious than Corinth. Materially speaking, you could get no more covetous and materialistic than at Corinth. Educationally speaking, you could get no more sophisticated than at Corinth. So what is the greatest need of this city and cities like it today? The gospel of Jesus Christ.

As we journey through this epistle of Paul to the church at Corinth, we find just how practical God's Word is. Issues like morality, marriage, Christian Liberty, spiritual gifts, the resurrection of the dead and much more will be covered. We will learn what real love looks like. We will be challenged, we will be convicted, we will think at times that Paul was writing this letter to the church in today's world. But as hard hitting and controversial as this book will be at times, we need to keep in mind that what drives Paul to write such a letter is not anger, but the love of God. For God so loved the world. Yes, even cities like Las Vegas, Hollywood, Rochester. The only hope for fallen man is Jesus Christ. The only message that can change a person's world is the heart changing gospel of Jesus Christ. Only the love of Christ can overcome the glitter and glamor of Corinth. Have you tasted that The Lord is good?</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;ACTS 18: 1-13&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(Verses 1-3) Paul arrives in Corinth and meets Aquila and Priscilla.

&lt;strong&gt;18.1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Corinth &lt;/strong&gt;was a Roman colony and the most influential city of the province of Achaia.

&lt;strong&gt;18.2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Aquila &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Priscilla &lt;/strong&gt;were a sold out couple for The Lord Jesus Christ. Every place in Scripture that we read their names, they are ministering together in The Lord.

&lt;strong&gt;Ac 18:18,26 Ro 16:3,4 1Co 16:19 2Ti 4:19.&lt;/strong&gt;

When Paul left Corinth, they went with him to Ephesus where they set up shop while Paul continued his journey to Jerusalem.When Apollos came to Ephesus they ministered to him.When Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians from Ephesus in about 59 AD, he told them that Priscilla and Aquilla send their greetings along with the church that was in their house.When a year later Paul wrote to the church in Rome, he told them to greet Priscilla and Aquilla who were his helpers in Christ Jesus.

What would God write about you and your spouses commitment to serving Christ in your home, in your church and in your community?

I suggest to you that Aquila and Priscilla are not the extreme, but the norm for each couple here this morning.

There are many people like them in this congregation and you do not hear about them, but what a great influence they have on others and what a wonderful work they do for the kingdom of God.

&lt;strong&gt;18.3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. &lt;/strong&gt;

Jewish fathers were urged to teach their sons a trade, and Paul learned tent making, an important industry in Tarsus. They had a saying that if you did not teach your son a trade, you were preparing him to be a thief.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 20.33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 2.9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 9 &lt;/strong&gt;may reflect this period of Pauls ministry in Corinth when he supported himself rather than receive support from te Corinthians.

(Verses 4-8) Paul's ministry among the Jews and Gentiles of Corinth

&lt;strong&gt;18.4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. &lt;/strong&gt;

Greek means to dispute. To converse, discourse with.

We know from &lt;strong&gt;Acts 17.2 , &lt;/strong&gt;that when Paul went into the synagogue, &lt;strong&gt;Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Scriptures that Paul used to testify abut Jesus being the Messiah were the Old Testament.

By the grace of God, Paul was a powerful witness for Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 17.17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.&lt;/strong&gt;

For too many Christians, the great commission has become the great omission. We are called to live a missional lifestyle in word and deed for the glory of God.

&lt;strong&gt;18.5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

When Timothy came, he brought news about how the Christians in Thessalonica were remaining steadfast in the faith (&lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 3:6-10&lt;/strong&gt;). This brought Paul great joy, spurring him on in ministry (&lt;strong&gt;Paul was compelled by the Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;). He answered back by writing 1 Thessalonians from Corinth.

He was compelled or constrained by The Spirit of God to testify about Jesus Christ. The Revised Version reads that he was constrained by the word, that is, by the gospel message.

Paul was not only moved by the love of Christ. He was also moved by the fear of eternal judgment&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5.11 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.&lt;/strong&gt;

Beloved, what we are doing here this morning is not playing church and the gospel of Jesus Christ is no joke.

&lt;strong&gt;18.6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. &lt;/strong&gt;

The blasphemy was directed against Jesus, because Paul was preaching Jesus as the Messiah.

The deep prejudice that many people have against Jesus can only be explained by understanding that Satan has blinded their eyes.

&lt;strong&gt;Shook his raiment&lt;/strong&gt;. Clothing. Shaking the dust from his garment was a sign of his innocence of their blood (&lt;strong&gt;20:26-27&lt;/strong&gt;) but judgment upon them (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 9:5&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;Your blood be on your own heads&lt;/strong&gt;, he was referring to their destruction and their own responsibility for it (cf. &lt;strong&gt; 33:16&lt;/strong&gt;). Paul has told them the truth. It is not his fault if they reject it.

Saints, you and I are not responsible for results. God holds us accountable for being faithful, regardless of how many people turn to Christ.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;18.7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. &lt;/strong&gt;

The first home of the Corinthian church. Titius Justus was a Gentile adherent to the faith at the synagogue, and a Roman citizen.

Did you catch that after Paul fled from the synagogue, he went right next door into the home of this saved Gentile!

&lt;strong&gt;18.8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Crispus &lt;/strong&gt;was the leader of the synagogue whom Paul led to Christ.Paul baptized him (&lt;strong&gt;1Co 1:14&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;Many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.&lt;/strong&gt; This describes the gospel process of conversion. The word is preached; faith comes by hearing (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 10:17&lt;/strong&gt;), confession (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 10:10&lt;/strong&gt;) and baptism (&lt;strong&gt;Ro 6:3,4&lt;/strong&gt;) follow.

(Verses 9-11) God's special encouragement to Paul in Corinth.

&lt;strong&gt;18.9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Be not afraid &lt;/strong&gt;implies that Paul had fears about how ministry was going here in Corinth.

&lt;strong&gt;18.10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: or I have much people in this city. &lt;/strong&gt;

Please note that Jesus didnt tell Paul that his opponents wouldnt &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to stop him, only that they would not be successful.

In the face of opposition, God steps in with faithful love to strengthen Pauls.

God promises &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Protection&lt;/span&gt;: despite the danger of Pauls opponents, God will ensure that they do not harm him; and &lt;strong&gt;(2) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Presence&lt;/span&gt;: God himself will be with Paul.

It is Gods presence&lt;strong&gt; (I am with you; Acts 18:10) &lt;/strong&gt;that not only energizes believers but protects them in the midst of fear, anxiety, and doubt. This is a recurring theme in Scripture: Gods perfect love and presence casts out fear

I have much people in this city. The Lord knows those that are His, yea, and those that shall be His. Through the preaching of the gospel, God will gather in His chosen flock from the places where they are scattered.

He will gather those who place faith in Jesus Christ this morning. The doctrines of election and predestination do not diminish the need for evangelism, they actually compel us to evangelize.

&lt;strong&gt;18.11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Vision- &lt;/strong&gt;This was the third of six visions given to Paul (cf. &lt;strong&gt;9:36 16:910 22:1718 23:11 27:2324&lt;/strong&gt;).

I have much people in this city. Though they were not yet converted, the Lord Jesus knew His chosen sheep whom He had redeemed and made sure they heard the gospel through His servant (Acts 13:48; John 10:14-16).

A year and six months. Pauls longest stay in any city, except Ephesus (&lt;strong&gt;20:31/3 years&lt;/strong&gt;) and Rome (&lt;strong&gt;28:30/2 years&lt;/strong&gt;). It was during this stay in Corinth that he wrote &lt;strong&gt;12 Thessalonians&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 14.3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 20.31 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.&lt;/strong&gt;

(1Verses 2-17) The Jews of Corinth attempt (unsuccessfully) to convict Paul before the civil authorities.

&lt;strong&gt;18.12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, &lt;/strong&gt;

The brother of Seneca, the philosopher, who was the tutor of Nero.

&lt;strong&gt;Deputy &lt;/strong&gt;or proconsul. The proconsul of a province was its chief judicial officer.

&lt;strong&gt;18.13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Contrary to the law&lt;/strong&gt;. The Jews were claiming that Paul was advocating a religion not recognized by Roman law as Judaism was.

In approaching the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth are trying to legally put a stop Paul not only in Corinth, but also in the entire province. These same kinds of things are happening in our day and age.

&lt;strong&gt;18.14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;18.15 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Gallio&lt;/strong&gt; was correct in seeing that the government has no legitimate role in attempting to decide religious matters, though government does have a legitimate role in matters of &lt;strong&gt;wrongdoing or wicked crimes&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;18.16 And he drave them from the judgment seat. 18.17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.&lt;/strong&gt;

A Sosthenes is included with Paul in the writing of 1 Corinthians&lt;strong&gt; (1:1). &lt;/strong&gt;Perhaps he was the second ruler of the synagogue at Corinth to become a Christian in response to Pauls preaching&lt;strong&gt; (see v. 8).&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/span&gt;

What have you done with the gospel of Jesus Christ?

What could a person possibly have against Jesus Christ is beyond me.

He taught that we were to love one another as we loved ourselves.

He taught us to be merciful towards those were opposed to us.

He taught us to pray for our enemies.

He taught us to forgive people their trespasses against us.

They taught us to help those who are in need.

What could you possibly have against the teaching of Jesus?

You may not want to hear this but Jesus Himself said in &lt;strong&gt;John 14.6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I Am the way, the truth and the life and no man can come unto The Father but by Me. &lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus also said that the reason why men do not believe His gospel is because the god of this world blinds them and because they loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.

But today, God is once again calling out to you to repent and believe upon His Son Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. If you would like prayer and talk about this new life in Jesus Christ, &lt;a href="mailto:contact@koinoniafellowship.com"&gt;contact me.&lt;/a&gt;

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>The church at Corinth was dealing with sexual immorality, believers taking one another to court, marital problems and the subject of marriage, believers stumbling one another in regards to eating meat offered to idols, people questioning Paul apostolic authority, chaos and disorder of spiritual gifts, a total lack of reverence in partaking of The Lords Supper, and, last but not least, some were spreading a heretical doctrine about the bodily resurrection.

Keep in mind as you process this list that this church is *&lt;strong&gt;sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints (1.2), in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (5-7). &lt;/strong&gt;

So, if you were writing a letter to correct this body of believers, where would you begin? What would be the first thing that you would address and put at the top of your list?&lt;!--more--&gt;

I find it very interesting that with all the problems Paul is going to address in this letter, the very first thing that The Holy Spirit impresses upon his heart is none of the above. He addresses division, disunity and discord within the church.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why? &lt;strong&gt;A house divided cannot stand.&lt;/strong&gt; A house that is not walking in the shadow of the cross and the grace and love of Jesus Christ is going to crash and burn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This problem of division, disunity and discord was contrary to the teaching and prayers of Jesus Himself.

&lt;strong&gt;John 17.20-23 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;schisma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul addresses a church that, like many in our day, is both deeply flawed and greatly loved. This is the 10th reference to The Lord Jesus Christ in the first 10 verses, leaving no doubt as to the One Paul believed should be the source and focus of Corinthian unity.

Paul begs them to be &lt;strong&gt;perfectly joined together&lt;/strong&gt; (v. 10), which in the Greek is a medical term that refers to the setting of a bone that was broken or out of joint. They were in Christ, but they were also broken, in the flesh and carnal relationally.

Paul is not exhorting the saints to &lt;strong&gt;all agree&lt;/strong&gt; on every subject, as our translation suggests. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;non-negotiabledoctrinal absolutes that must all embrace as the body of Christ. Butas we unpack this book,we will soon come to chapters 8-10, which deal with matters of conscience and secondary issues. Paul &lt;em&gt;expects&lt;/em&gt; Christians to disagree as to matters of conscience and secondary issues.

When Christians have different convictions onwhat we callneutral matters, or secondary issues, they are not to dispute with one another over them (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14:1&lt;/strong&gt;). Rather they are to keep their convictions to themselves (&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14:22&lt;/strong&gt;).

If we were speaking in musical terms, Paul is not calling for the church to sing in unisoneveryone singing the same note at the same timebut rather he is urging the entire church to sing the same song, in harmony. This is what Christian unity is about.

Augustine wrote: &lt;em&gt;In essentials unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, charity.&lt;/em&gt;

What is&lt;strong&gt; the same mind? &lt;/strong&gt;that Paul is referring to here? It is the mind of Christ&lt;strong&gt;. Phil. 2:58 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Contentions &lt;/strong&gt;comes from a Greek word that speaks of strife, quarreling, and wrangling that was taking place in the church at Corinth. The primary problem in the church at Corinth was a disunity problem, and it needed to get nipped in the proverbial butt.

Please note that in verse 10 and 11, Paul addresses them as brothers. He addresses them from the perspective of not just an apostle, but also a brother in Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;1.12 Now this I say, that every one (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the entire church&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

Lets take a brief look at the 4 different styles of ministry that the church in Corinth were blessed by.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul&lt;/strong&gt; - Paul was considered the apostle to the Gentiles because he emphasized truths that would be especially important to the Gentile mind. He also clarified the limited need for Gentiles to follow Jewish ritual and dietary laws.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollos&lt;/strong&gt; - Apollos made a major impact upon the Corinthian church after Pauls departure. He was noted as a gifted speaker, which would have contrasted Paul, who was not known as an eloquent speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cephas&lt;/strong&gt; - This was a term for Peter and was a reference to the apostle who was known as one called to minister to the Jews. As seen in &lt;strong&gt;Galatians 2:11-17&lt;/strong&gt;, Peters emphasis was different than Pauls because he helped the Jews incorporate their traditions and beliefs with their faith in Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ&lt;/strong&gt; - This seems to refer to a group that took pride in making direct reference to the teachings of Jesus and disregarded the legitimate place of the apostles and prophets in the early church.Any church, denomination or ministry that are built upon personalities and preferences instead of Jesus Christ is a recipe for disaster, because the moment the personality dies, or is out of the picture, the foundation crumbles of the ministry crumbles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There were factions developing within the church following these gifted leaders: there was a Paul faction, an Apollos faction, a Cephas (Peter) faction, and a faction that seemed to be more pompous than the rest by claiming to be of Christ.

I might add here that I do not believe that any of these men were cause the divisions. They all contended together for the faith. They maintained the unity of the Spirit, and they all exalted Jesus Christ. It was the members of the church in Corinth who were guilty of making the divisions.

These factions were not theological in nature given that each one taught the same gospel. All believers belong to Christ (&lt;strong&gt;3:22-23&lt;/strong&gt;), so He should not be claimed as just another party.

Paul explains why they were divided: they had their eyes on men instead of on Christ. They were trusting in the wisdom of men (&lt;strong&gt;2:5&lt;/strong&gt;); they were glorying in the works of men (&lt;strong&gt;3:21&lt;/strong&gt;); andthey were comparing one servant with another and boasting about their favorite teacher.They were infatuated with &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;their favorite teacher taught or preached &lt;/em&gt;to the point where they could not receive the truth from any of the other vessels God raised up.

In &lt;strong&gt;chapter 3&lt;/strong&gt;, Paul proves that this infatuation with men was a mark of carnal living, evidence that these spiritual Corinthians were actually babes in Christ.

To elevate a human teacher to the point where the allegiance shatters the body of Christ means that we have lost sight of the infinite and overwhelming worth of a crucified Savior.

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 23:8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-12 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?&lt;/strong&gt;

It appears that these saints were taking pride in the person who baptized them. Some people appear to have been proud and looked down on others who were not baptized by as great a celebrity teacher as their baptizer.

In verses 13-17, Paul lets the air out of the tires of these proud name droppers by telling them that baptism is not a celebrity affair, and compared to the preaching of the gospel

To be divided into factions contradicts the very nature of the church that has many members but is one body.

The three questions in this verse were rhetorical and expected a definite no. These questions highlight the absurdity of a selfish, party spirit within the church.

Pastor Chuck Smith said, &lt;em&gt;When the body of Christ is divided, who bleeds&lt;/em&gt;? Jesus.

G. Campbell Morgan said,"&lt;em&gt;I have noted that the more spiritual a man becomes, the less denominational he becomes&lt;/em&gt;."

How serious is division, disunity and discord? In the Old Testament book of &lt;strong&gt;Proverbs&lt;/strong&gt;, chapter &lt;strong&gt;16&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;19&lt;/strong&gt;, we find things that God calls an abomination.

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 6.16 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 6.19 he that soweth discord among brethren&lt;/strong&gt;

The Hebrew word for abomination means, something disgusting; a tragic mistake.

A person that sows division, disunity and discord among the brethren within the church is an abomination in the eyes of God, equal to the sexual perversion or abominations listed in &lt;strong&gt;Leviticus 18.22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Leviticus 20:13&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;This is how serious Paul saw the issues of division, disunity and discord. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; &lt;/strong&gt;

The synagogue ruler whose conversion is recorded in&lt;strong&gt; Acts 18:8.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1.16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul assumes that all believers have experienced baptism and that they have been instructed about its meaning.

The gospel is the power of God unto salvation for all who believe; baptism is a symbolic expression of that belief. The gospel is the good news that anyone who receives Christ as Savior and Lord will be saved. Baptism is a public expression of that salvation and the testimony of Jesus Christ and His saving grace.

Water Baptism is not pointless. It was commanded by Christ

&lt;strong&gt;Matt. 28:19&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&lt;/strong&gt;

Practiced by the early church &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:41&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized:and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls&lt;/strong&gt;.

Water baptism and The Lords Supper, are the two ordinances that are practiced by the church.

Have you been water baptized since you came to faith in Jesus Christ? Sign up in welcome center.

&lt;strong&gt;1.17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;void of power and authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul's denial does not degrade baptism; he is simply emphasizing that baptizing is not his primary role. As an apostle, Paul's primary job is to preach the gospel, teaching those seeking God to be baptized. The one who performs a baptism is God's instrument; the convert's loyalty must be to God alone.

The phrase &lt;strong&gt;wisdom of words&lt;/strong&gt; refers to a kind of rhetoric and persuasion that characterized the Greek orators. Paul preached the good news of Gods salvation through the cross of Christ in plain speech, not in a manner that manipulated or impressed his hearers.

Paul never burned out because his goal was simple and singular, never changing, never wavering. I came to you, he said, preaching nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

&lt;u&gt;The problem of exalting men&lt;/u&gt;

Whenever we exalt the vessel, and thereby diminish the treasure inside, we have diminished the ministry of Christ.

&lt;u&gt;Is there anything about the way you live the Christian life that calls attention to humans rather than the Lord who is at the heart of your faith?&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;The body is one&lt;/u&gt;

Just as a physical body, though made up of many members, is one, so also the church, which is the body of Christ, cannot be divided. The church is one, and it is our responsibility before God to endeavor to maintain that unity of The Spirit in the bond of peace. &lt;u&gt;Are you an agent of unity or an agent of division, disunity and discord in the body of Christ or in this church family? &lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Gods one message of salvation and counseling&lt;/u&gt;

As we see all throughout the New Testament epistles, the church is not the home of sinless, perfect people, but perfectly redeemed people who are saints. The epistles deal with doctrinal issues. They deal with practical and morality issues. They deal with marital issues and the issues of family life. They deal with the workplace and finances. In other words, church problems are people and sinners problems, and life at times can be messy and complex.

&lt;em&gt;Every sin starts within because our whole lives are oriented in the direction of ourselves. -&lt;/em&gt;Alistair Begg

But I submit to you dear church family that the solution to every problem that plagues every person is the same: The gospel of Jesus Christ and Him crucified.

In the cross of Jesus Christ we obtain forgiveness, healing, deliverance, mercy, patience, grace, understanding, love and power to walk in newness of life.

&lt;u&gt;Have you trusted Jesus Christ as Lord of your life? Savior of your soul? &lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 1.11-13He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

A decision to live separate from Jesus in this life is a decision to live separate from Jesus in the next.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Theres no one in the world quite like a mother.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;She gave us life, and if that wasnt miraculous enough, she provided us with more love and support than we ever could have dreamed of. She mopped up all the messes weve left behind, from toddler tantrums to tempestuous teenage rows. Shes forgiven us, encouraged us and shaped the people we have become. Just one day a year: Mothers Day, isnt enough to thank the woman whose love we can always rely on. Its difficult to put their sacrifice into words. Being a mother pays nothing, it is a 24 hour a day role that carries on demanding love and attention for a whole lifetime. A mothers love really is like nothing else. &lt;/em&gt;

Secular society and the liberal church have an agenda to demean diminish and destroy the biblical definition of what it means to be a godly woman, mother and wife.

Because the ultimate purpose for a woman who loves Jesus is to live for Him and His glory. I thought it would be a good thing to look at a few Scriptures that describe the character of a woman after Gods own heart.

Precious sisters, in a world where outward charm and physical beauty reign as queen, your precious Savior and Lover of your soul Jesus Christ would say to you:

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 31.30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.&lt;/strong&gt;

Today, I give thanks and praise to all thewomen here this morning who love Jesus and serve Him in their marriage, their home, this church and in the midst of a fallen and broken world.

I give a special word of thanks and praise to my wife who is all of this a much more.

Lets take a look at some of the more prevalent passages of Scripture on being a godly wife and mother.

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 31.10-12 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. &lt;/strong&gt;

It is the worldly, fleshly, self-centered woman who looks at &lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 31 &lt;/strong&gt;and says along with the mantra of this fallen world system that such demands or expectations are archaic and were meant for women who lived in the dark ages.

The wise woman on the other hand looks at the &lt;strong&gt;31 &lt;/strong&gt;virtuous women of &lt;strong&gt;Proverbs &lt;/strong&gt;and knows that this is a description of a godly wife, mother or woman of any era or any culture.

It is from that life of virtue that all of the other ingredients listed in chapter 31 flow from this woman. Her husband trusts her, and she makes it her constant business as his helpmeet to do him good. She looks well to all the ways of her household. She is industrious and prudent. She opens her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness. Her children and husband praise her.

There is not one selfish drop of sweat in this "virtuous woman" chapter, because all that she is doing for her husband and family is first and foremost being done for the glory of God.

It is getting harder and harder to find a virtuous woman in our society. That is because there are less and less women following Jesus and submissive to His Lordship.

You precious sisters who love Jesus and submit to Him are a rare jewel in todays society. You precious sisters who love Jesus and submit to Him are real examples of what it means to be a wife, mother and godly woman.

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5.22-24 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and He is the savior of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.&lt;/strong&gt;

As we learn in this chapter, we learn that marriage exists to show the glory of Christ. It is not a social contract formed when and how we please. It is not a convenience for satisfying our desires. It is Gods display case for the beautiful relationship between Christ and His church.

Thus, a woman's role of submission is a picture of how the church lovingly submits to Jesus Christ.

A godly woman recognizes her role in the marriage as being oneof submission to her husband, not as a slave, but as a helpmeet. A wise and Jesus-loving wife will not try to undermine her husband's authority or leadership.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3.1-6 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.&lt;/strong&gt;

A godly womans submission to her husband stems from a quiet confidence, which is the fruit of her faith and trust in God.

Keep in mind that what Peter writes here is the counsel of God that Peter is giving to the Christian woman who is married to a non-Christian man &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; a man who is not living like a Christian. Consult Abigail in &lt;strong&gt;1 Samuel 25 &lt;/strong&gt;for some idea of what this kind of husband might look like.

The elaborate braiding of womens hair and the wearing of attention-grabbing jewelry were common in upper-class Roman society. Peter is not literally prohibiting all braiding of hair or all wearing of gold jewelry. Instead, he warns against being more concerned about personal appearance than Christ-like character on the inside.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 2.9,10 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&lt;/strong&gt;

Thus, when we sum up what we have see thus far in &lt;strong&gt;Proverbs, Ephesians, 1 Peter and 1 Timothy, &lt;/strong&gt;we learn that a woman after Gods own heart will possess 3 outstanding qualities:

She will be deeply devoted to The Lord Jesus Christ and His glory. This devotion to Jesus will affect her manner of speaking, her manner of dressing. She will have a servants heart and will be industrious. She has a heart for the poor and needy. Thus, she is a woman of Jesus-like compassion.

She will be biblically committed to her covenant vows that she made before God and with her husband.

She will be an example of the heart and compassion of Jesus Christ towards her children.

Yes, the husband is the head of the marriage and the home; but the wife is the heart and soul of the home.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Timothy 1.5&lt;/strong&gt; tells us about the incredible impact that Timothys mother and grandmother had upon his life as a follower of Jesus Christ. A godly wife and mother impact the life of their children and grandchildren.

Lets spend the final few minutes together with the admonition given by the apostle Paul to pastor Titus.

My dear sisters in Christ, I draw your attention this morning to the ONLY standard that matters for a woman who loves Jesus and aspires to follow Him all the days of her life. That standard is the unchanging, culture and trend-defying Word of God.

&lt;strong&gt;Titus 2.1-5 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&lt;/strong&gt;

These are timeless character truths of God that transcend all cultures, trends and mores of society. These character truths are the things that become &lt;strong&gt;sound doctrine&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Holiness, &lt;/strong&gt;or reverence will be their underlying character.

&lt;strong&gt;Not false accusers- &lt;/strong&gt;She has control over her tongue. Greek &lt;em&gt;diabolos, &lt;/em&gt;one who accuses falsely. As we saw in Proverbs 31, the law of kindness is on her lips.

&lt;strong&gt;Not given to wine- &lt;/strong&gt;Not addicted or enslaved to alcohol. As we read in &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5.18, &lt;/strong&gt;she is Spirit filled, not substance controlled.

They are to be &lt;strong&gt;Teachers of good things, &lt;/strong&gt;which are:

&lt;strong&gt;Teach young women to be sober- &lt;/strong&gt;To be moderate or self controlled. They bring calm to the home, not chaos.

&lt;strong&gt;Love their husbands- &lt;/strong&gt;(not somebody elses husband!) to be fond and affectionate.

&lt;strong&gt;Love their children- &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Discreet- &lt;/strong&gt;curbing one's desires and impulses, self- controlled, temperate.

&lt;strong&gt;Chaste- &lt;/strong&gt;Pure and reverent. The world idolizes physical beauty, but those who are in Christ place a higher priority on holiness and purity onm the inside. Thus, the exhortation for older women to teach the younger women wherein real beauty lies.

&lt;strong&gt;Keepers at home- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;oikouros;&lt;/em&gt; a stayer at home, i. e. domestically inclined. The (watch or) keeper of the house.

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 14.1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Good- &lt;/strong&gt;Good-natured, pleasant, agreeable, joyful.

&lt;strong&gt;Obedient to their own husbands- &lt;/strong&gt;A Greek military term meaning "to arrange [troop divisions] in a military fashion under the command of a leader."

Why does God tell women to live this way?For one thing, this is the kind of a woman that a husband and children &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to have around them.

&lt;strong&gt;That the Word of God be not blasphemed- &lt;/strong&gt;spoken evil of. Beloved, our marriages and families have the potential to be a steppingstone or a stumbling stone to others coming to faith in Jesus.

Lets join our hearts together in thanks and prayer for every single wife, mother and sister.

We love you, we appreciate you, we pray that Gods face and grace will shine upon you and give you peace.

&amp;nbsp;

		<title>The Gospel Of Romans</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/the-gospel-of-romans/</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;When we study the book of Romans, it would serve us well to look at what The Spirit of God says about the gospel in this book. The Greek word for gospel, as many of you know, means basically good news. Thirteen times we find the word gospel in this book, and with every passage we find wonderful truths that speak volumes to our heart. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The gospel is the good news of Gods Son, The Lord Jesus Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 1:9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John 3:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Jesus is the Good News of God sent to take away the sin of the world (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John 1:29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). This gospel of Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 1:16, 15:19,29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe it. Note in those gospel of Christ passages how Paul ties in Christs salvation- bringing gospel with fullness of blessing. How blessed the man is who knows Christ and has been given forgiveness of sin (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 4:6-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;)! Only the gospel of Christ can grant forgiveness of sin and give a person a new heart (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hebrews 8:10; Galatians 6:15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Paul tirelessly brought this gospel wherever the Spirit of God opened the door (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 Corinthians 16:9; Romans 15:20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), in the power of Gods Spirit (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 15:19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Twice in the book of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Isaiah &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;52:7 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;53:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) we see that this gospel was foretold. Thus the gospel of the Suffering Messiah would be called the gospel of peace and be spread by the beautiful feet of His redeemed servants (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 10:14,15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This gospel was no afterthought, beloved; it was not plan B because plan A failed. This gospel was kept secret (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 16:25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), but was revealed to all mankind in these last days (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hebrews 1:1,2: 1 Peter 1:10- 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Twice in this book Paul refers to the gospel as my gospel (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 2:16, 16:25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The good news of Christ is of no value to the person who is living in unbelief. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lastly, Paul refers to himself being separated unto this gospel (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 1:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). This is the language of deep commitment. Is the gospel that we have been studying your gospel? Are you and I fully devoted to Christ? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;2.6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Perfect &lt;/strong&gt;here does not mean sinless; it means to be an adult or mature. This wisdom is beyond human intelligence or ability to comprehend.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 1.19-21 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Mystery &lt;/strong&gt;is a Greek word that describes something previously hidden or unknown that has now been revealed. Many &lt;strong&gt;mysteries &lt;/strong&gt;are spoken of in the New Testament.

&lt;strong&gt;Mark 4.11 mystery of the kingdom.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.51 mystery of the bodily resurrection of the dead.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 5.32 mystery of the church.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Thessalonians 2.7 mystery of iniquity.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 3.16 mystery of godliness, &lt;/strong&gt;the Incarnation

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 1.20 mystery of the 7 stars.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 17.5 mystery Babylon the great. &lt;/strong&gt;

And what is this glorious mystery that Paul is referring to here?

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 3.3-6 How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 1.27 the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Holy Spirit has brought this revelation of Christ to the church through the apostles, and now God has chosen to make His Son Jesus Christ known through the preaching of the gospel.

It appears from Scripture that the processes God uses to bring His truth to man:

&lt;strong&gt;1) Revelation&lt;/strong&gt; = that which is revealed to a prophet or apostle; may come inform of dream or vision

&lt;strong&gt;2) Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; = the prophet would either speak or write down those words tocommunicate that truth to others; &lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3) Illumination&lt;/strong&gt; = an insight fromprevious revelation that was inspired by God and is made known to us through the Spirit of God.

It must be pointed out that since the Scriptures have been completed, The Spirit of God is not giving any new or additional revelations.

This &lt;strong&gt;hidden wisdom ordained by God before the foundation of the world &lt;em&gt;unto our glory&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;

That we should inherit glory through the gospel of Jesus Christ is the eternal plan of God.

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 13.34,35 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1.18-21 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Princes of this world- &lt;/strong&gt;This is not referring to devils, as some have thought. Had the devil and the principalities of darkness known what God had designed to do by the death of Christ, they would never have been concerned in bringing it about. This teaches us that Satan is not omniscient or all knowing.

Nor is this a reference to the political governors of the Roman Empire, particularly in Judea, as Herod and Pontius Pilate, who also were entirely ignorant of it.

I believe that the &lt;strong&gt;princes of this world&lt;/strong&gt; refer to the &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical rulers of the Jewish people such as the priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, the Rabbis and learned doctors&lt;/em&gt;. These knew nothing of the wisdom of the Gospel, or the wise counsels of God concerning salvation by Christ; they knew not the Messiah when He came, nor the prophecies concerning Him.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 3.13-18 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; &lt;em&gt;whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; And killed the Prince of life&lt;/em&gt;, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. And now, &lt;em&gt;brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Lord of glory &lt;/strong&gt;expresses that the grandeur and honor of Jesus is &lt;em&gt;equal to that of God the Father Himself&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 24.7, &lt;/strong&gt;Jehovah is called the &lt;strong&gt;King of glory. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Lord Jesus Christ is called&lt;strong&gt; The Lord of glory &lt;/strong&gt;because He alone possesses all of the glorious perfections of The Father, and is Himself the brightness of his Fathers glory.&lt;strong&gt;If you have seen Me, you have seen The Father. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Holy Spirit links Jesus, The Lord of Glory with the crucified Messiah. This is what is known theologically as &lt;em&gt;the hypostatic union&lt;/em&gt;. This is the union of two natures (divine and human) within the single person of Christ (Cp. &lt;strong&gt;John 1.1;1.14; Philippians 2.5-8)&lt;/strong&gt;.

This dual nature of being fully man and fully God distinguishes Jesus Christ from the description of Jesus according to any and all other religions or faiths.

What &lt;strong&gt;the rulers of this age&lt;/strong&gt; could not and cannot see is that &lt;em&gt;the path to glory is through the cross&lt;/em&gt;.

What this teaches us &lt;em&gt;by way of a biblical principle is &lt;/em&gt;that the key of &lt;strong&gt;life and that more abundantly &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is also&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; through the cross.&lt;/em&gt; Jesus said in

&lt;strong&gt;Luke 9.23, 24 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And He said to them all, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but &lt;em&gt;whosoever will lose his life for My sake&lt;/em&gt;, the same shall save it. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away.&lt;/strong&gt;

The path to fulfillment in life &lt;em&gt;is not found by self-indulgence&lt;/em&gt;, but by self-denial &lt;em&gt;for the cause of Jesus Christ. &lt;/em&gt;Death to our proud and selfish ways for the glory of Jesus Christ is the pathway to fulfillment.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.9 But as it is written (Isa 64.4), Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Who are these glorious and incredible truths revealed to and prepared for?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Them that love Him. &lt;/strong&gt;Inthe originaltext it is, &lt;em&gt;for him that waiteth for Him&lt;/em&gt;; the sense is the same, for such ashope in the Lord and wait for him, are lovers of him.

According to Scripture, the best proof or display of love for Jesus is obedience to His commandments from the heart.

&lt;strong&gt;John 14.21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 14.23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. &lt;/strong&gt;

In the parable of the 2 sons, it was the son &lt;em&gt;who did &lt;/em&gt;Gods will that loved The Father, not the son &lt;em&gt;who knew Gods will but refused to obey. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Timothy 4.8 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.&lt;/strong&gt;

An individual who loves Jesus Christ is going to be a person who is daily &lt;strong&gt;about His Fathers business &lt;/strong&gt;as they eagerly look for the immanent coming of The Lord Jesus.

&lt;strong&gt;2.10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revealed- &lt;/strong&gt;Greek word &lt;em&gt;apokalypto;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;to uncover, lay open what has been veiled or covered up. To make known, make manifest, disclose what before was secret.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The deep things of God. &lt;/strong&gt;God prepares things beyond human comprehension for those who are His. The deep things of God does not mean that we fully understand the perfections of the nature of God, which are past finding out. Nor does it mean that we will be able to understand the depths of His wise and mysterious acts of providence.

It means that we are able to understand the fellowship of the gospel mystery which was hidden but are now revealed in the word.

&lt;strong&gt;2.11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

Man by natural wisdom does not know God. Man by investigation of all the natural forces of life will never find his way to the heart of God.

When God revealed to Daniel the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzars dream in &lt;strong&gt;Daniel 2.16, &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel declared:

&lt;strong&gt;Daniel 2.22 He revealeth the deep and secret things: He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.&lt;/strong&gt;

We may know from creation that there is aCreator,but we will not be able to knowWhothat Creator is personally apart from His Spirit revealing Him to us.

Paul lays down the fact that the only person who can tell us about God is the Spirit of God Himself. There are deep and intimate things about God that only His Spirit knows. Thus, the Holy Spirit is the only person who can lead us into genuine, intimate knowledge of God.

&lt;strong&gt;2.12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. &lt;/strong&gt;

What is the spirit of the world? The Greek word &lt;em&gt;cosmos, &lt;/em&gt;means, &lt;em&gt;the whole circle of earthly goods, endowments riches, advantages, pleasures, etc, which although hollow and frail and fleeting, stir desire, seduce from God and are obstacles to the cause of Christ. &lt;/em&gt;

David Robertson said: &lt;em&gt;The pleasures that people seek without God is like a person who is trying to quench their thirst by drinking salt water.&lt;/em&gt; That is what Jesus told the woman at the well in &lt;strong&gt;John 4.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Comparing spiritual things with spiritual- &lt;/strong&gt;Since all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God, we understand Scripture by comparing Scripture with Scripture.

The Holy Spirit reveals the &lt;strong&gt;things that are freely given to us of God. &lt;/strong&gt;Things like the promises of God; the pleasures of God. Things like righteousness, peace and joy in The Holy Ghost.

In verses 14 and 15, Paul distinguishes all of mankind into two kinds of men, the &lt;strong&gt;natural man &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;spiritual man. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gr. Moria; silliness; absurd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2.15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word for the English word &lt;strong&gt;natural &lt;/strong&gt;is the same word that is translated "&lt;em&gt;sensual&lt;/em&gt;" in &lt;strong&gt;Jude 19. &lt;/strong&gt; That word is used to idescribe a person who does not have the Spirit. &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.9 If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His. &lt;/strong&gt;

To&lt;strong&gt; the natural &lt;/strong&gt;or unsaved &lt;strong&gt;man, &lt;/strong&gt;the message that a man dies on the cross for our sin is foolishness. &lt;em&gt;Foolishness is an assessment you make of something you have understood but regard as ridiculous. &lt;/em&gt;

To &lt;strong&gt;the natural man, in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth &lt;/strong&gt;is foolishness. &lt;em&gt;Thus, the basic problem is not an intellectual inability to construe the meaning of Paul's message; the problem is the moral inability to assign the right value to it.&lt;/em&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;spiritual man &lt;/strong&gt;is the person that has been regenerated by The Spirit, by grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. The first and most fundamental work of God's Spirit in the life of the natural man is to shatter pride. When the Spirit of God is at work in your life, you will then begin to appraise things the way God does. You will not regard the Word of God as folly but &lt;strong&gt;more necessary than your necessary&lt;/strong&gt; food..

A spiritual man &lt;strong&gt;judges all things. &lt;/strong&gt;That does not mean that he or she is a judgmental person. It means that he or she scrutinizes, sifts, and prays through all situations and decisions in life, and seeks to walk in the wisdom and counsel of God.

&lt;strong&gt;2.16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;mind of Christ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is not &lt;/em&gt;the referring to the instrument of natural thinking&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It is the mindset of Gods profound wisdom regarding salvation through a crucified Messiah, which was hidden, but is now revealed to the church by The Holy Spirit.

The manual of operation for the Christian wartime mentality is the Bible. It contains the truth needed to win us over from the enemy to Christ, to deprogram our old thought patterns, to train us in strategies of righteousness, and to equip us with armor and weapons to defeat Satan and liberate his captives.

Having the mind of Christ, we now are in the ongoing process of being &lt;strong&gt;transformed and renewed in the spirit of our mind that we may prove what is that good, perfect and acceptable will of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 9:28 Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time unto salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him. &lt;/strong&gt;

The question before us all is: Are we included in the many whose sins he bore? And will we be saved by His coming untosalvation?

The answer of &lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 9:28&lt;/strong&gt; is, Yes, &lt;em&gt;if we are eagerly awaiting him&lt;/em&gt;. We can know that our sins are taken away and that we will be safe in the judgment if we trust Christ in such a way that it makes us eager for his coming.

There is a phony faith that claims to believe in Christ, but is only a fire insurance policy. Phony faith believes only to escape hell. It has no real desire for Christ. In fact, it would prefer it if he did not come, so that we can have as much of this worlds pleasures as possible. This shows that a heart is not with Christ, but with the world.

So the issue for us is: Do we eagerly long for the coming of Christ? Or do we want him to wait while our love affair with the world runs its course? That is the

The problem of man is inside of himself. The only answer of man is outside of himself.The problem isn't someone else or something else. The problem is sin in me, and the only answer for sin is Jesus Christ.

In &lt;strong&gt;Mark 2.1-12&lt;/strong&gt;, Jesus Himself teaches us that the greatest need of every human being, regardless of his or her outward estate, is the need to be forgiven.

I am here this morning to tell you this morning that Jesus is the only One Who can forgive you, because all of our sin &lt;em&gt;ultimately &lt;/em&gt;has been committed against Him.

David said, &lt;strong&gt;against Thee and Thee only have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight.&lt;/strong&gt;

Do you know what sin David was referring to? Sleeping with another mans wife. But he said that his great sin was against God.

Beloved, the only sin that Jesus bore on His cross was your sin, my sin.

The only wrath and punishment that Jesus absorbed on His cross was the wrath and punishment that we deserve. God has made a way for sinners to be forgiven and reconciled to Him and one another, and that one Way is Jesus Christ. Will you embrace Him this morning as follow Him as Lord?

		<title>The Epistles Of John</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/the-epistles-of-john/</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Today we will begin to look at the three epistles written by the Apostle John. John was the last living apostle and it is almost unanimously agreed that he wrote these epistles at the end of the first century. Already, though, there had crept into the church false teachers and heresies that The Spirit of God calls antichrist (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 2:18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). This spirit of antichrist lies about the true identity of Jesus Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 2:22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), and is the very root of deception regarding The Person and ministry of The Lord Jesus Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 4:3; 2 John 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). This very same spirit of antichrist is as vibrant today as it was in Johns day. In fact, it has grown over the years of church history so that the Jesus of modern man is a far cry from the Christ of Scripture, King of kings and Lord of lords (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Revelation 17:14, 19:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;At the time of Johns three epistles, the most dominant heresy the church needed to confront was Gnosticism. This doctrine was a revelation of deep spiritual insights that revealed spiritual secrets that only the enlightened could understand. As any doctrine of demons (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 Timothy 4:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), there was a seductive element in their message that appealed to their intellects (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 2:26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Satan is The Master of all spiritual seduction. He has his own evangelists and prophets who perform false signs and wonders, and who seek to seduce the people of God into the bed of spiritual idolatry (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Mark 13:22; Revelation 2:20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Johns epistle was written to give to the true church joy (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 1:4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) and full assurance of salvation through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 5:13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). John clearly states that talking our faith and living it out are two entirely different things (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 John 1:6, 2:4,6,9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The Epistle of John is a no nonsense letter that causes us, as Paul also exhorts, to examine ourselves to see whether we are in the faith (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Corinthians 13:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Please pray that The Spirit of God will reveal these glorious truths about Jesus Christ to our hearts in order that we individually and congregationally may be able with our lips and with our lives, contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jude 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;4.1 Let a man so account of us (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;consider us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), as of the ministers (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;servants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 4.2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 4.3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;human court&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): yea, I judge not mine own self. 4.4 For I know nothing by myself (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;against myself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); yet am I not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord. 4.5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) the counsels (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;motives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

The context of verses 1-5 brings out 3 main thoughts.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul describes that the outstanding character of the office a pastor of the church is that of being a servant of The Lord Jesus Christ.Paul urges the Corinthians &lt;em&gt;not to think of himself, Peter or Apollos as leaders of parties, but as servants of The Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paulshows that an absolutely essential part of being a spiritual overseers responsibility in the body of Christ is that he be a faithful steward in dispensing the mysteries of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even though the matter of the judgment formed of him by the Corinthians was absurd. He calls both himself and others to remember that there is a time when The Lord will bring to light every single deed and the motive behind them at The Judgment Seat of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
But as we so often see when we work our way through Scriptures, in expounding the immediate context, we are going to come across and bring out some biblical principles regarding servanthood, stewardship and judging others that applies to all of us who are in the body of Christ.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ministers/Servants&lt;/strong&gt;

Lets talk a bit about what it means to be a servant.

Paul was an apostle; as was Peter. That was their office. But here he expresses his humility by using a Greek word for servants that literally means. Under rowers to express what his title was before God.

There are several different words in the language of the New Testament to describe a servant. Here, Paul uses the word that was used to describe the lowest, most menial, and most despised galley slaves, who rowed on the bottom tier of a ship. The sole responsibility of the under rower was to row according to their captain's bidding.

This definition of the term servant or under rower quickly dispels the contemporary image of the pastor or spiritual overseer as being a CEO or spiritual leader of rock star or superstar status.

Spiritual overseers in the body of Christ are called to be servants. Whether the call of God is to be a bishop, pastor, elder or deacon, we are all under rowers in the body of Christ who are ultimately responsible to our Captain, The Lord Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 1.1 Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle. &lt;/strong&gt;

An under rower doesnt set the course or determine the direction of the ship independent of his Captains command or will.

A spiritual under rowers ministerial duty has already been set by The Lord Jesus Christ and it know as the Great Commission which is essentially two-fold:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Winning lost souls to Christ by preaching the gospel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making disciples by the teaching of Gods Word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
These 2 responsibilities are to be carried out within the local church according to the specific leading and guidance of The Lord Jesus Christ Who has declared I will build My church.

There may indeed be varying degrees of calling and accountability within our very own church family. But at the end of the day, our churchis called to be a Spirit filled, God glorifying, and Christ centered community of servants.

Jesus said, &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 23.10-12 Neither be ye called masters: for One is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.&lt;/strong&gt;

There is only One Master here at Koinonia Fellowship, and that is The Lord Jesus Christ.

To be a true servant of Jesus Christ requires humility. There is no room for pride or personal agendas, because pride divides and quenches the Spirit of God.

And Who is our example of what it means to be a servant? The Lord Jesus Christ Himself.

&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 2.5-8 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/strong&gt;

Consider the humility of Jesus Christ in the Incarnation. Pauls message for every person who calls thistheir home church to have the same humble, self denying mindset as Jesus Himself.

&lt;strong&gt;John 13.12-17 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus assumed the garments and position of a common servant. His self-humbling act of washing feet is meant to be an example to all believers. Think of whose feet Jesus washed.

&lt;strong&gt;Mark 10.42-45 Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many&lt;/strong&gt;

The highest calling of any human being on earth is to be a servant of The Most High God. Jesus came to serve, not to be served. Greatness in God's kingdom is measured by a servant's heart that is driven by a supreme love for The Lord Jesus Christ and the honor and glory that is due His Name.

A servant of God does not need a title, a crowd, or a stage in order to serve. A servant of God serves Jesus Christ because he or she has understood the love and grace of Calvary and has cultivated the reality of the power and presence of Jesus Christ in their lives.

In addition to being servants, Paul also declares that he and any other spiritual overseers are called to be &lt;strong&gt;stewards of the mysteries of God&lt;/strong&gt;.

A steward is someone who serves as an administrator or overseer of something that belongs to someone else.

A spiritual steward in the body of Christ is a person who is called to feed Gods people The Word of God. When Jesus restored Peter, He said &lt;u&gt;Peter if you love Me, feed My sheep. &lt;/u&gt;

Spiritual overseers are called by God to be faithful dispensers of the mysteries of God. A mystery being a divine revelation previously hidden.Here the word mystery is used in its broadest sense as pertaining to Gods full revealed truth in the NT.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Timothy 3.16-4.5 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. &lt;/strong&gt;

Spiritual overseers are called to bring forth the truth of Gods Word instead of tickling peoples ears with things that they want to hear to suit their own carnal passions and pleasures. Scripture is not given to make me feel good about however I am living. Scripture is given that I might know how to live good, think right, be holy and bring glory to God.

Spiritual stewards are not called by God to mix the teaching of Scripture with psychology, philosophy, sociology or worldly methodology. Beware of any teacher who uses psychology, philosophy, sociology of methodology to prove the truth of Scripture.

Beloved, read The Word, love The Word, embrace The Word, live The Word and let science, education, and all and any other ologys bow the knee to the authority of Scripture.

What kind of a &lt;strong&gt;steward&lt;/strong&gt; are you?

Everybody in the body of Christ is a steward. The word steward reminds all of us in the body of Christ that all that we possess ultimately belongs to God. A steward is not the owner, but the operator, and manager of what belongs to The Lord.

This means that the use of our finances, possessions, time, and gifts are to be done with the interests and purposes of The Lord Jesus Christ and His kingdom at heart and in focus.

For the uses of these things, good or bad, we will be held accountable at The Judgment Seat of Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Stewards are required to be fond faithful. &lt;/strong&gt;Faithful, not famous.Faithful, not popular. Faithful, not hip or cool. Faithful, not flashy. The most essential quality of all servants or stewards in the body of Christ is to be obedient to our Master, Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Vs. 3-5 &lt;/strong&gt;In these 3 verses, Paul presents three kinds of judgment: (1) &lt;u&gt;the judgment of people&lt;/u&gt;, which he does not fear; (2) &lt;u&gt;self-judgment&lt;/u&gt;, and he says he knows nothing against himself (not by himself); and (3) &lt;u&gt;the judgment of God&lt;/u&gt;, which is the only true judgment.

The judgment of people-&lt;strong&gt;Judged by you&lt;/strong&gt; Paul was, in a manner of speaking, on trial in Corinth; the members were passing judgment upon his talents, upon his motives, upon his administration. It even appears that some of the Corinthians were critical of Paul because of his lack of eloquence (&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 2:34; 2 Cor. 10:10&lt;/strong&gt;).

As sure as the sun rises in the east and sets in the whether we like it or not, if you are in any public ministry position, you will inevitably face the scrutiny and judgment of others. It is something that we cannot avoid. Paul was not callous or contemptuous of the opinion of others. Yet the critics in his life did not direct Pauls life. They were not at the steering wheel of his life. The cross and love of Jesus were the driving power of Pauls life and ministry.

The judgment of himself-&lt;strong&gt;I know nothing against myself.&lt;/strong&gt;

In spite of the absurd accusations lodged against the authenticity of Pauls apostleship and teaching; Paul could say before God that his doctrine and motivation for ministry was pure. &lt;u&gt;In the book of Acts, we read:&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 23.1And looking intently at the council, Paul said, Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.&lt;/strong&gt;

He goes on to say to the Corinthians that a human verdict on his life is not the one that matters, even if it was his own.But please note here that he still recognized that even his own judgments were only human and he realized that even his own conscience could be mistaken.

&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 17.9,10 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.&lt;/strong&gt;

Just because we feel confident about our actions or motivations, we should never be so puffed up with pride that we assume we are always correct in our personal views and actions. Keep in mind beloved that when somebody judges us, right or wrong, we should be extremely thankful because we all know worse things about ourselves than does the person who is criticizing us.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 10.18 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.&lt;/strong&gt;

The judgment of God-&lt;strong&gt;He that judges me is The Lord &lt;/strong&gt;

This refers to the time when God will eventually bring to light the secret acts of all individuals, exposing their true thoughts, attitudes and motivesgood as well as bad.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5.9-11 Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences. &lt;/strong&gt;

The terror of the Lord (the appropriate reverential awe or fear of our Creator and Judge vv. 9, 10), coupled with the love of Christ (vs 14) strengthens our resolve to serve Him and please Him, as well motivate us to persuade others to trust in Christ.

He repeats here what he previously pointed out to them in &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 3.13.&lt;/strong&gt;Each one's work will become manifest, for the Judgment eat of Christ will disclose it. Every thought, word deed and motive will be revealed or exposed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 21.2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew10:26there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. &lt;/strong&gt;

Scripture is very clear when it declares that the final and ultimate evaluation of any ministry and the motives for serving the people of God belongs to God alone.

An important point to make regarding the matter of judging. &lt;u&gt;The typical response of people who are confronted when they are clearly out or order or are living outside of the prescribed moral will of God is &lt;strong&gt;judge not and you shall not be judged. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

Please bear in mind beloved that Paul is not speaking here of judging the actions of men, which may be reckoned good or bad according to the word of the Lord, which he is most certainly going to do throughout this epistle.When Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount, &lt;u&gt;judge not and you shall not be judged. He proceeded to warn them about false prophets. To recognize a false prophet you need to be able to make a judgment based upon truth Scripture. &lt;/u&gt;

So when Paul is telling us to not judge, he is not saying that we should not call sin a sin.

He is not saying that we should not address someone who is biblically out of order.

He is not saying that we should not call out false teachers or heretical teaching by name.

Closing Remarks

Each one of us will appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ. What is going to be judged there? We know that we shall not be judged for our sins, because a believers sins have been removed as far as the east is from the west (&lt;strong&gt;Ps. 103:12&lt;/strong&gt;). Our sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ and God remembers them no more. The believer will be judged for his stewardship.

I truly believe that at he Judgment Seat of Christ, there will be many unrecognized saints who will be rewarded, not because they did some great thing or had some great gift, but because they were faithful in the little or behind the scenes things that they did for the glory of God. Beloved, be faithful to The Lord in all that you do. God does not call us to be famous, but faithful.

Am I a servant (under rower) of The Lord Jesus Christ? Am I using the time, talents, resources and abilities that God has given me to display His glory and the furtherance of His gospel? Am I investing the time, talents, resources and abilities that God has given me into the lives of others, both inside and outside of the church for the glory of God?

Jesus said, &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 6.24&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. &lt;/strong&gt;

Just as the eye cannot be divided, neither can the heart be divided. The call to salvation, by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, is also the call to be a disciple and serve Him in Spirit and in truth with a single eye and heart.

No human being can have more than one master in his or her life. You cannot be totally devoted to God &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;anything else anymore than you can be married to more than one person at a time.

Is Jesus Christ Lord of your life? Have you repented of your sin and placed all of you faith for forgiveness of sin squarely upon His sacrifice on the cross? Are you willing to follow Him as Master and Lord of your life, no turning back?

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Now that the first missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas has been completed. The churches, which God established through them in the Galatian country, are nearly 100 percent Gentiles. This presents the church with its first great crisis.

Here is the crux of the matter: In Judea, many of the Hebrew converts are Pharisees who have no intention of giving up the Mosaic system. They assert that the Gentiles must also come into the church through the Mosaic system. In fact, they believe that Gentiles are not saved until they are circumcised.

The news of this contention reaches the church in Jerusalem. The apostles must now face up to the question. What course is the church to take? So in Jerusalem the first church council convenes to resolve the matter.

We need to realize here that what is being challenged here is the gospel of the grace of our Jesus Christ.

Through their system of sacrifices, the people of Israel were given prophetic types and shadows that pointed them to the once and for all, forever sacrifice that was coming, the true spotless Lamb who would take away their sins forever (John 1:29). Instead, they attempted to attain their own righteousness before God through fulfilling the laws commands, which only served to place them and all who sat under their teaching under the yoke of guilt-driven slavery and bondage.

Religion and legalism are the twin pillars of guilt and fear: They constantly cause you to ask the question, have I done enough? Have I given enough? Have I sacrificed enough? Is God pleased with me now? True freedom from guilt comes only when we recognize the boundless and undeserved love that God has poured out on us through His Son. Jesus has done enough for God to be pleased with us.

If the apostles did not take this stand for the gospel of grace, Christianity would have become another denomination under the banner of Orthodox Judaism.

&lt;strong&gt;15.1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) ye be circumcised after the manner (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;custom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of Moses, ye cannot be saved. &lt;/strong&gt;

Now this was the doctrine or teachings of the legalists in the early days. Today people would say unless you tithe or keep the Sabbath or are water baptized you cannot be saved.

Think of what these legalists are saying. They are tampering with the most sacred and mysterious act of God in both time and eternity. The once and for all sacrifice of the sinless, spotless, Lamb of God, The Lord Jesus Christ for the sin of the world.

&lt;strong&gt;15.2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. &lt;/strong&gt;

Note that the testimony of the gospel of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ was the cause of great joy; in contrast with the message of graceless religion and legalism that only causes condemnation, discouragement and despair.

&lt;strong&gt;15.4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.&lt;/strong&gt;

Do you see what is happening here, beloved? The Pharisees wanted to add something to the gospel. Saints, whenever you add something to the gospel, you no longer have the free grace gospel of Jesus Christ; you have a religious system.

Jesus said, &lt;strong&gt;beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. &lt;/strong&gt;

Later, Paul would write to the Galatians about adding circumcision to the finished work of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 2.1-5 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.&lt;/strong&gt;

And what is the truth of the gospel? That we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in the perfect sacrifice of The Lord Jesus Christ alone.

&lt;strong&gt;15.6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. &lt;/strong&gt;

Peter is referring to his meeting with Cornelius and others:

&lt;strong&gt; Acts 10.38-48&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

In &lt;strong&gt;Acts 10&lt;/strong&gt;, Peter himself had to learn that salvation is not decided by whether one eats meat or doesnt eat meat, whether one eats pork or doesnt eat pork. Salvation is not dependent on our observation of the Sabbath, or Sunday, or any other day. Salvation is by grace through faith. We are free to choose what we wish to do about these other things. We have freedom in that connection.

&lt;strong&gt;15.8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;God knows our hearts- &lt;/strong&gt;This is both comforting and disturbing. God knows our thoughts afar off, or in the origins.

&lt;strong&gt;15.9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Gentiles were saved by faith in their hearts, not by circumcision in their flesh. The only way that our hearts are purified in the sight of God is by faith in Jesus Christ. Not by observing rituals. Not by our good works.

They were purified &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;of their faith in Jesus Christ, not &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;their faith in Jesus Christ.

The gospel is not clean up your act first, then follow Me. That is religion. That is hard-core legalism. The gospel is come unto Jesus just the way you are, and He will clean you up.

&lt;strong&gt;15.10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? &lt;/strong&gt;

To tempt or test God is very serious indeed. Jesus told Satan, you shall not tempt The Lord our God. To add circumcision and the keeping of Law of Moses to faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sin and salvation is testing God, because, in effect it means that the sacrificial death of Christ was not quite enough to effect salvation.

Simon Peter makes a tremendous admission here. He says that neither they nor their fathers kept the Law. I have said this many times before, and I will say it many, many times more: God has never saved anybody through the keeping of the Law. Do you know why? There has never been a person who has kept it. God saves on one basis and one basis only: faith in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

Peter watched Jesus engage in a constant conflict with the Pharisees for 3 years. He watched Jesus dismantle the unbiblical legalistic teachings and traditions of their spiritual fathers.

Peter heard Jesus say to those who were being held in the yoke of bondage and tied up in religious knots:

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11.28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 15.11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.&lt;/strong&gt;

Note that Peter says to these Jewish legalists that &lt;strong&gt;we (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) shall be saved, even as they (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gentiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;He does not say that the Gentiles or Jews need to be saved by keeping the law.

If circumcision is unnecessary for salvation, then why are restrictions given to the Gentiles:

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 15.28,29 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.&lt;/strong&gt;

Here we see an example of the principle of respect for the weaker brother (cf. Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8). The counsel to respect dietary restrictions was intended to demonstrate love and respect for the Jewish Christians. Because of their background, Jewish Christians would have struggled to share a meal with Gentiles who seemed to flaunt traditional Jewish dietary customs.

The Jerusalem council aims to avoid such potentially divisive offense by instructing the Gentiles not only to abstain from obvious sin (sexual immorality or fornication) but also to accommodate the sensitivities of their Jewish brothers and sisters. The response of the Gentile believersjoyshows that they hardly view these requirements as burdensome.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 15.31 When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement. &lt;/strong&gt;Because they knew that Jesus Christ laid down His life and freedom for their sake; these Gentile believers found in Christ and through Christ the example and joy in laying down their freedoms out of love for others. Some people misread the gospel of salvation by grace alone as being an open door for careless, loose, prodigal living.

Salvation by grace does not diminish submission to Gods Word and the call of God to be holy, for "I, The Lord your God, am holy."

We need to understand that according to &lt;strong&gt;James 2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1 John&lt;/strong&gt; that where there is genuine regeneration and faith in Jesus, there will be genuine evidence of love, works and the fruit of The Spirit for the glory of God.

Salvation by grace does not set aside the moral law of God. Salvation by grace sets aside the &lt;em&gt;requirement &lt;/em&gt;or keeping or observing the ceremonial law as a means of salvation.

When a person is born again and comes to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, they dont start partying, they stop partying. They dont continue engaging in sexual sin, they stop it. They do not become more interested and entangled with the things of this world; they become less interested and entangled with the things of this world.

As we prepare our hearts to partake of The Lords Supper, we must first of understand in our hearts and minds that the gospel is revealed in two senses in the New Testament.

&lt;u&gt;First of all, there are the facts of the gospel.&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.1-5 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures; And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve. &lt;/strong&gt;

The facts of the gospel are the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Christ.

&lt;u&gt;The second sense of the gospel is the interpretation of the facts&lt;/u&gt;. It is this interpretation which is the basic truth in the Epistle to the Galatians. That is the crux of the whole matter at this first council at Jerusalem. Thus the gospel also hinges on this fact that Paul states in &lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3:22: But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;u&gt;What must one do to be saved?&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 2:1516:We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. &lt;/strong&gt;

Have you properly understood the gospel? Are you tempting God by seeking to get right with Him by your good works? Will you trust Christ and Christ alone for your salvation? The gospel is not try harder, do more, but repent of your sin and trust Jesus Christ alone.</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>In this section of Corinthians, Paul is actually writing to 2 groups of individuals.First of all, in verses 14-17, he is writing to the church in Corinth at large. This is the church that he planted by the grace of God on his second missionary journey. It was in Corinth that Paul planted the seed, Apollos watered it, and God gave the increase.The second group is the false brethren who had crept in and were planting seeds of division and dissension amongst them. They are addressed in verses 18-21. They were challenging Pauls apostleship and spiritual authority.

Though there were individuals who formed cliques in Corinth around their favorite teacher, we are completely missing the point if we think that the rivalry at Corinth is between the followers of certain apostles like Paul or Apollos or Peter.Apollos, Peter, or Paul, all aimed at nothing but the advancement of Christ's kingdom. It is implied in our texts this morning that Paul is addressing the real cliques and division that were established around personal allegiance to certain unnamed men, who are not apostles.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4.14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. &lt;/strong&gt;

Pauls pastoral heart is revealed in these words. The harsh language of the previous section that we covered last week was not intended to make them feel inferior, but to raise their sensitivity and understanding to the truth of what was going on around them. Paul soothes the soreness and discomfort of his rebuke by reminding them that he loves them like a father.The very word which he uses in &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor.4:14&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;warn&lt;/strong&gt; is the word regularly used to express the admonition and advice which a father gives his children. (&lt;strong&gt;Eph.6:4&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;em&gt;He may be speaking with the accents of severity; but it is not the severity that seeks to bring an unruly slave to heel, but the severity that seeks to put back on the right rails a foolish son who has gone astray. &lt;/em&gt;Wm. Barclay

Having established Pauls fatherly heart in dealing with this matter, let's not ignore the fact that Paul is without question issuing a warning with apostolic authority. A warning that if gone unheeded will result in severe consequences.

Such consequences as will be found in the next chapter when Paul "&lt;strong&gt;deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus" (1 Cor 5.5) &lt;/strong&gt;and "&lt;strong&gt;Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme" (1 Tim.1.20).&lt;/strong&gt;

Beloved, if you are convicted of sinful behavior by a warning in Scripture, do not make the mistake of ignoring it because you have trusted Jesus to be your Savior. 2 Corinthians tells us that the man in Corinth who was delivered over to Satan repented of his sin was a brother that was forgiven and restored to fellowship. He stopped living in sexual sin. He didnt explain it away or make excuses for his sinful behaviour.

There are people who proclaim Christ as Lord that have completely disconnected their unbiblical, sinful behavior or lifestyles from the consequences or warning of Scripture as having anything to do with them under the wrong interpretation of the meaning of grace. That is a very dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;Shall we sin (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;practice sin; live in sin; love sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) that grace may abound? God forbid. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4.15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word for the English word &lt;strong&gt;instructors &lt;/strong&gt;refers to the guardians who were responsible to oversee the children. The &lt;em&gt;instructor&lt;/em&gt; was a guardian or "slave-guide," who escorted the children to and from school, and who supervised their general conduct. No matter how many instructors the Corinthians had, (good or bad), Paul reminds them that that they were like his children &lt;strong&gt;in Christ&lt;/strong&gt; through the preaching of the gospel.

Paul could make this claim of father because God used him to lead many of the Corinthians to faith in Christ.The apostle reminds them that his fatherly relationship to them is unique and that they were in grave danger of suffering sever consequences if they continued to disregard his biblical instruction and insisted on listening the unbiblical instruction of his detractors and the lies they were telling them about him and their false claims of spiritual authority.

&lt;strong&gt;4.16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. &lt;/strong&gt;

He would later write to them&lt;strong&gt;"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ" (1 Cor 11.1)&lt;/strong&gt;

Here there are two things to be observed in the words of Paul here:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, Paul proposes nothing to others that he had not first practiced himself;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Second, Paul points both himself and others to Christ as the only pattern of right acting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Follow Christ and be an example. What a timeless pattern for every Christian leader, teacher, parent or grandparent.

Pauls answer and solution to their divisive, carnal, and unbiblical behavior was to point them to Christ and the path he himself has chosen. The path of the cross.Their carnality, divisiveness and disorder was not because they were denying self and following Christ, but because they were doing that which was right in their own eyes.

Each one of us here this morning can only choose to walk on one of two paths. The wide path that leads to destruction, or the narrow path that leads unto life. The path of self-life or the path of the cross.

&lt;strong&gt;Matt 16.24-26 If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4.17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.&lt;/strong&gt;

According to &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 16.16, &lt;/strong&gt;Timothy was traveling throughout Macedonia at this time and Paul expected that he would ultimately be reaching Corinth.Timothyhad been discipled so faithfully by Paul that he could be sent in his place with confidence that he would perfectly represent him. No doubt he sent Timothy in the hopes of diffusing a potentially ugly situation and confrontation with these false teachers and loose canons within the church who were maligning Paul, out of order, out of control and thus, out of line.The work which Timothy was to do was to remind the Corinthians of what they seem to have forgotten, viz., of Paul's ways which were in Christ, and what he taught.

The Christian life is spoken of as a way or ways. It is a manner of life or pattern of life. It is not a merely the knowledge of doctrines to which we nod our heads, disconnected from any personal application. It is a life that has been radically transformed by the power of The Holy Spirit that impacts others for the cause of Christ and the glory of His Name.

&lt;strong&gt;4.18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul writes these words in &lt;strong&gt;2 Cor 10.1,2,&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.&lt;/strong&gt;

These unnamed individuals who were challenging Pauls apostleship and authority were puffed up with pride, thinking they would never have to face Paul again.

&lt;strong&gt;4.19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. &lt;/strong&gt;

We can be sure that whoever these individuals are, they most certainly knew that Paul was talking about them and to them. The reality of how much real spiritual power they had would become clear in that confrontation.Paul warns that if The Lord allows him to go to Corinth, he will back up his legitimate claim as spiritual overseer of the people not with endless words, but with the manifestation of God given spiritual authority and power.

There are always going to be individuals who seek to undermine and challenge God ordained leadership. They did it is the days of Paul and the other apostles, and they do it today. Wolves or loose canons prey on sheep. They isolate them in order to plant seeds of doubt, distrust and uncertainty about their spiritual leaders teachings in the minds of Gods people.

That is not to say that those in leadership are beyond correction or reproof. Paul confronted Peter for his unbiblical behavior. That is not to say that incorrect teaching must be corrected.The clause "if the Lord will" reminds us that we should not promise anything to others as to thefuture, or to determine with ourselves, without adding this limitation in so far as the Lord will permit. This is what James writes about in (&lt;strong&gt;James 4:15&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;4.20 For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. &lt;/strong&gt;

The kingdom of God reveals itself in power, which means that following Jesus Christ in Spirit and in truth is more than talk. Genuine conversion will give birth to a living witness of The Lord Jesus Christ by the power of the Spirit as well. Faith apart from corresponding actions, good works or fruit for the glory of God is not saving faith.

Saving faith is a living faith. Where the Spirit of Christ is there will be the power of a transformed life. There will be fruit and good works for the glory of God.

&lt;strong&gt;4.21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Rod- &lt;/strong&gt;A thin stick used for discipline. Paul speaks metaphorically of the consequence of church discipline as he describes it and implements it in&lt;strong&gt; 1 Cor 5:35.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;What do you want?&lt;/strong&gt; Paul leaves the ball in their court. Which Paul did they want to come? The Paul with the &lt;strong&gt;rod&lt;/strong&gt; of correction (&lt;em&gt;used by shepherds to smack disobedient sheep and wolves&lt;/em&gt;), or the Paul with the &lt;strong&gt;spirit of gentleness?&lt;/strong&gt; There is no doubt Paul would prefer to come in gentleness, but he'll leave that decision up to the Corinthians.

We talked about some pretty intense things today, didnt we? Spiritual authority. Church discipline. Wolves and loose canons in sheeps clothing in the church. Carnal living as opposed to daily cross bearing.

&lt;u&gt;A word about church leadership&lt;/u&gt;

The local church is not a dictatorship, but neither is it social club without any rules that is void of biblical spiritual authority and oversight. Spiritual authority is not a power trip or a control trip. Yes, spiritual authority has been abused and misused, but it cannot be ignored or treated as if it doesnt exist.

But it is crystal clear in the Scriptures that spiritual leadership is not only the sacred trust of feeding, caring and nourishing of Gods people. Spiritual leadership is only the mandate of God given to men for the purpose of establishing God ordained order, accountability, and when necessary, discipline, for which they will be held accountable.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 13.17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;u&gt;A word to our church family&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Follow me, as I follow Christ.&lt;/strong&gt; Can I say that? Can we say that? Can you say that? Heads up all parents and grandparents, aunts, uncles, older brothers and sisters.

&lt;em&gt;A young boy looked up at his grandfather and wondered aloud, Grandpa, how do you live for Jesus? The respected grandfather stooped down and quietly told the boy, Just watch. As the years went by the grandfather was an example to the boy of how to follow Jesus. He stayed rock-steady in living for Him. Yet the grandson often lived in a way that was not pleasing to God. One day the young man visited his grandfather for what both knew would be the last time. As the older man lay dying, his grandson leaned over the bed and heard his grandpa whisper, Did you watch? That was the turning point in the boys life. He understood that when his grandpa had said, Just watch, he meant, Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. He vowed that from then on he would live as his grandfather didstriving to please Jesus. He had watched, and now he knew how to live. &lt;/em&gt;Keith Krell

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthains 10.31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 5.13-16 Ye are the salt of the earth:but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;u&gt;A word to those who are not sure about their salvation&lt;/u&gt;

Jesus asked the disciples the great question of all time; But whom say ye that I am? The world has its opinion of Christ. Religions of the world have their opinion of who Christ is. But did it ever occur to you and me beloved that our lives, and this church family are issuing a constant verdict of who Christ is?

Do your actions and lifestyle say that Jesus Christ is a person that you only run to in time of need, but when the crisis is over or the need has been met, for all intents and purposes, Jesus is a tag along with your lifes vocation, hobbies or interests?

Do you have an orthodox opinion about Christ in your head and theology, but your life is disconnected from His commands, warnings or Lordship?

What does the message of your life declare to those who read it day in and day about who Jesus Christ is?

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>William Barclay tells us in his commentary &lt;em&gt;(The Greeks) were characteristically a litigious people. The law courts were one of their chief entertainments... In a Greek city, every man was more or less a lawyer, &amp;amp; spent a very great part of his time either deciding or listening to law cases&lt;/em&gt;.

Sounds like today, doesnt it? People like Judge Judy have been lifted to celebrity status, and their shows are among the most watched on cable television.The national motto of our nation seems to have changed from In God we trust to See you in court!

Unfortunately, the statistics of Christians taking one another to court is not much better than the world. In his book Inappropriate Legal Actions, Doug Goins writes:

&lt;em&gt;Christian neighbors are suing each other. Christian faculty members are now filing suit against the administrations of Christian schools. Churches are suing one another. Churches are suing their pastors, and vice versa. Brothers and sisters in the family of God are actually pressing charges, demanding their rights, sometimes to the exclusion of any attempt to reconcile face-to-face. We are a culture gone mad. &lt;/em&gt;

It is this kind of problem that Paul addresses here in our study today.

&lt;strong&gt;6.1 Dare any of you (&lt;/strong&gt;Lit. &lt;em&gt;How dare you? What are you thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), having a matter (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;case, dispute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? &lt;/strong&gt;

Keep in mind that the kind of lawsuit Paul is talking about would have been handled before the public, in the open marketplace. &lt;em&gt;When court was held in Corinth, the parties were obliged to appear that had a civil suit to bring. For the purpose of resolving matters, the contending parties could then select a number of men from the list of the nobles whose names were entered in the rolls as possible judges; for according to Roman custom the contending parties were granted this right in order that they might place full confidence in the integrity of the men who were to act as judges.&lt;/em&gt;

Paul is using this term &lt;strong&gt;unjust&lt;/strong&gt; in a religious sense, not a moral sense. &lt;strong&gt;Unjust,&lt;/strong&gt; in the sense of meaning, "&lt;em&gt;not justified before God, not saved&lt;/em&gt;." He is not suggesting that all of the judges in Corinth were evil. He is simply saying that they were not Christians.

&lt;strong&gt;Dare any of you? &lt;/strong&gt;What a horrible witness for the body of Christ to be found wrangling and disputing before a Gentile court of unsaved judges and spectators, while at the same time confessing to be followers of the Prince of Peace Who has given unto us the ministry of reconciliation!

By their actions and bad attitudes towards one another, the unsaved concluded that &lt;em&gt;those who professed to have new life in Jesus Christ were really no different than anyone else&lt;/em&gt;. Whether we want to hear it or not, the unsaved world in part determines the validity of the gospel of Jesus Christ by the evidence of His power working in and through our lives and how we treat one another.

The Spirit anointed counsel of Paul is this: when one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers. And he qualifies their ability to do that by the statements that we read in the next 2 verses.

&lt;strong&gt;6.2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;incompetent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to judge the smallest matters?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Do you not know? &lt;/strong&gt;6 times in this chapter Paul is going to repeat this question. And the question is implying that they &lt;em&gt;did know. &lt;/em&gt;They had the knowledge, but failed to apply it to their lives. The purpose of Scripture is that we might apply its truth to our lives.

&lt;strong&gt;We shall judge the world &amp;amp; angels. &lt;/strong&gt;I do not have a clue as to exactly how or in what capacity we will judge the world and fallen angels. But this much I do know. Scriptures teach that we shall rule and reign with Him on the earth during the 1,000 year reign of Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 149.5-9 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 19.28 And Jesus said unto them (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the disciples&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 20.4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Do you not know? &lt;/strong&gt;Since they were taught that as saints (&lt;em&gt;that is all who are in Christ&lt;/em&gt;), they were going to judge the world and angels, Paul tells the Corinthians, Cant you go before The Lord, seek His face and resolve these issues among yourselves? Shouldnt you be able to settle these kinds of disputes within the church?

&lt;strong&gt;Smallest matters- &lt;/strong&gt;Many scholars believe that these small matters were disputes were over money or property issues. Things related to our day-to-day life on earth.

Please keep in mind, beloved, that Paul is not attacking the validity or necessity of &lt;strong&gt;secular courts&lt;/strong&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&amp;amp;c=13&amp;amp;v=3-4#s=1059003"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 13:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Paul says that it is appropriate for the state to handle criminal cases. Christians should, however, be able to handle &lt;em&gt;civil&lt;/em&gt; cases among themselves.Scripture reveals to us that Paul showed by his actions that he was not against all legal action. In &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=22&amp;amp;v=25#s=1040025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acts 22:25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=25&amp;amp;v=10-11#s=1043010"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25:10-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he appealed to Roman courts for his rights.His concern was that &lt;em&gt;followers of Jesus Christ were using the court system to air one anothers dirty laundry and a place to settle their personal monetary and property disputes instead of going to the body of Christ! &lt;/em&gt;

It is so sad to Christians air their dirty laundry on social media for the entire world to see. Out of the abundance of the heart Facebook posts! Too many saints spend far too much time of social media. Go visit an elderly saint or someone who is sick.

&lt;strong&gt;6.4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 6.5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? &lt;/strong&gt;

We learned last Sunday that Paul told them in the last chapter to purge out the old leaven. The old leaven is the old life or the old way of doing things.Granted, there may indeed have been some problems between these saints over issues of money and property. But the question that Paul repeats over and over is why are you insisting on handling these kinds of matters like you did before you were saved? Why are you going to the world to solve your disputes instead of the church? His intention of telling them this was &lt;em&gt;not to condemn them, but to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;shame them&lt;/em&gt;. He then asks them, Isnt there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues?

What a blow to their pride! These are the ones who are so very wise. These are the ones so quick to judge Paul and find him wanting. These very saints can proudly follow one leader and condemn the rest. Where are these Corinthian wise ones and critics when they are needed?

&lt;strong&gt;6.6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in front of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) the unbelievers.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul tells then that it is fundamentally and morally wrong when &lt;strong&gt;brother goes to law against brother&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;6.7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. (&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? 6.8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. &lt;/strong&gt;

For the carnal, competitive Corinthians, the old way of living was all about winning and losing. Lawsuits were about winning and losing. That old leaven had crept into the church.

Once again, I am absolutely certain that if there were crimes committed that revealed a threat to others; then these believers would be under moral responsibility to seek the authority of the human courts so that punishment and imprisonment would protect others.But by using the words &lt;strong&gt;defraud &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;defrauded&lt;/strong&gt;, we understand that the legal issues these believers had with one another were related to financial or property business dealings.

Paul insists that going to court with a fellow-believer in such cases is a no-win situationa total defeat. Their persistence and insisting on litigation in court instead of in the church was a demonstration of greed, animosity, and a desire for revenge or retaliation.

Reconciliation is the goal of the Christian gospel. Retribution or restitution is the goal of litigation. Reconciliation can be initiated immediately; litigation drags on endlessly.

Let me quote some Scripture that speaks directly to this matter.

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 5.38,39 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also&lt;/strong&gt;

To let yourselves be cheated for the sake of Christs Name and honor is to turn the other cheek&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Take wrong (vs 7); wrong (vs 8). &lt;/strong&gt;The word that is translated &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; is the same Greek verb that Paul used in verse 1 to describe the &lt;strong&gt;unjust&lt;/strong&gt; judges. Once again, with fatherly love and apostolic authority, Paul is telling the Corinthians that by handling matters their own way instead of Gods way, they are acting more like unbelievers than followers of The Living God.

&lt;strong&gt;Why not suffer wrong? &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, it is preferable for a follower of Jesus Christ to lose his &lt;strong&gt;money &lt;/strong&gt;rather, than lose their testimony and bring shame to The Name of Jesus Christ.

Beloved, always seek to do what is right in the sight of The Lord and leave all of the results and consequences, good or bad, up to Him.

&lt;strong&gt;6.9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 6.10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Dont be deceived- &lt;/strong&gt;Paul seeks here to awaken these people to any false security they may have as being a Christian by simply attending the services of this church. Some may have embraced Christianity as a system of doctrine in their head, but not as a rule of life in their heart.

As we saw last Sunday, there were some in Corinth who were deceived into believing that even if they were unfaithful to Christ, abandoning their relationship with Him and defying Him through immoral or unjust behavior, their salvation and inheritance in Gods kingdom were still secure. Paul repeats this same sobering warning often (e. g., &lt;strong&gt;Gal 5:19-21&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Eph 5:5-6).&lt;/strong&gt;

Who will not inherit the kingdom of God?

&lt;strong&gt;Fornicators- Gr. &lt;/strong&gt;Pornos- it is translated fornicator 5x, whoremonger 5x. This refers to any form of sexual immorality.

&lt;strong&gt;Idolaters- &lt;/strong&gt;Worshipper of false gods. This could be a guy who likes his electronics more than God; or a gal who likes her shoes more than God; or a pastor who loves his library and theology more than God.

&lt;strong&gt;Adulterers- &lt;/strong&gt;A married person who engages is sex with anyone who is not their spouse. What did Jesus say adultery is for any Pharisees who may be in our midst today?

&lt;strong&gt;Effeminate- &lt;/strong&gt;a male who submits his body to unnatural lewdness. &lt;em&gt;Catamite&lt;/em&gt;, a male who submits to homosexuals.

&lt;strong&gt;Abusers of themselves with mankind-&lt;/strong&gt; Sodomite: one who lies with a male as with a female, homosexual. Those who exchange and corrupt normal male- female sexual roles and relations.

&lt;strong&gt;Thieves- &lt;/strong&gt;a stealer or embezzler

&lt;strong&gt;Covetous- &lt;/strong&gt;Pleon is the basic word for more in quantity, quality, and number. Pleonazo means to do more, make more, or increase. Pleonekteo means to overreach. Pleonexia is avarice. Pleonektes means a greedy covetousness so eager for gain that it will defraud others. A person consumed with pleonektes will violate laws for unlawful gain. He will cunningly forge ahead at others expense.&lt;strong&gt; Eph. 5:3 &lt;/strong&gt;tells us covetousness is idolatry. Idolatry is an aggravated form of self- love motivated by ego.

&lt;strong&gt;Drunkards- &lt;/strong&gt;A person who repeatedly sits long at the drink and is intoxicated.

&lt;strong&gt;Revilers-&lt;/strong&gt;People who use their words to destroy others with words.

&lt;strong&gt;Extortioners- &lt;/strong&gt;Extortioners and embezzlers are individuals who steal indirectly, taking unfair advantage of others for their own financial gain.

Paul is not saying that a single transgression will causea person to lose his salvation. What he is saying is that no one who can allow him or herself the indulgence of known sin in this life can be saved. Mere mental assent to doctrines or to the facts of the atonement or gospel of The Lordship of Jesus Christ is not sufficient for salvation.

Let me read to you &lt;strong&gt;1 John 3.4-10 &lt;/strong&gt;from the ESV

&lt;strong&gt;Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother&lt;/strong&gt;

Persistence in wickedness and sinful behavior is an indication that a persons faith is false and that they have no place in the kingdom. People who live like this are lost.

&lt;strong&gt;6.11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Such were some of you- &lt;/strong&gt;Here Paul cites the fact that there were some in Corinth who were formerly described in the list of sins listed in verse 10.

The word &lt;strong&gt;but &lt;/strong&gt;here is used by The Holy Spirit to reveal the stark contrast the old life and new life in Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5.17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Washed&lt;/strong&gt; - This refers to the regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit that purifies a person from their past sins (&lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:5&lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;Sanctified&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a word for being set apart. It is our conversion to God that sets us apart for Him. We are sanctified or set apart from the world, the devil, and our sinful nature. We are set apart for The Masters use.

&lt;strong&gt;Justified&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a term conveys the fact of a believers new standing before God as guiltless for our sin (&lt;strong&gt;Rom. 5:1&lt;/strong&gt;). Just as if Ive never sinned.

&lt;strong&gt;By The Spirit of our God- &lt;/strong&gt;The Holy Spirit is the agent of salvations transformation&lt;strong&gt; (cf. John 3:35)&lt;/strong&gt;

The gospel is about sinners who are turned from a lifestyle of sin to lifestyle of holiness and righteousness. The gospel is about turning away from the sins which once dominated us. It is one of the greatest comforts for the Christian. What we were as unbelievers, we are not now as Christians. Our sins of the past are not only forgiven, God forgets them.

&lt;u&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/u&gt;

These passages today gave us a clear censure and condemnation of a list of sinful lifestyles that will not inherit the kingdom of God. Paul repeats them in Galatians 5, Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3.

In light of the recent Supreme Court decision to legalize same sex marriage, it is clear that among those sins is homosexuality. Those who would like to justify the practice of homosexuality today want us to believe that Paul is speaking of homosexual prostitution, not a "loving, caring homosexual relationship." But taken in context, there is &lt;em&gt;no doubt&lt;/em&gt; God is speaking of homosexual acts of all kinds. This is not a new sin.

It was called sin in Sodom in the book of Genesis. It was called sin in the book of Judges 19. It was sin in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. It is still sin today. That is not hate speech. That is agreeing with Scripture.

In the book of &lt;strong&gt;Romans 1.26-28 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient. &lt;/strong&gt;

Reprobate does not mean beyond the power of God to save. If Gods Word exposed a sin this morning that would disqualify you from inheriting the kingdom of God. I have great news for you. Christ Jesus died for sinners. He died for the ungodly. He died to destroy the works of the devil, not man.

The gospel message is that God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to taste death for every man. Some people think that adulterers, fornicators, homosexuals, drunkards and thieves are beyond the power of God to save or deliver from.

Keep in mind that some of the Corinthians were once these people. So were many of you, myself for sure. But the good news is that &lt;em&gt;there is hope in The Lord Jesus Christ for every kind of sinner, and every kind of sin; and when that sinner repents of his sin and turns to Jesus Christ, he or she need never turn back. Will you trust Him today? &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 86.5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee &lt;/strong&gt;

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>The prevailing attitude in the city of Corinth, notorious for its moral permissiveness and tolerance had infiltrated into church life and given rise to an ugly situation which necessitated Paul to reiterate the basic Christian moral prescription: flee from sexual immorality (6:18).

This twisted view of Christian liberty was contrary to the true meaning of grace and the exhortation to pursue holiness and purity in the fear of God.

The Corinthians seemed to think that what they did in their body did not affect their spiritual state, when in fact their overindulgence and sexual sins contradicted their union with Christ.

Not only had some church members begun to indulge in immoral practices by misusing their bodies (leading to gluttony and sex outside marriage), they were claiming justification for their actions in the name of Christian liberty (6:12: the first part of each sentence is in quotation marks, cited from the Corinthians letter to Paul). The apostle responds with a crystal-clear statement of Christian ethics and with some principles that are as relevant today as when he first expressed them.

One of the catastrophic consequences of the fall of man is that we have become totally poisoned with self. Self love, and the pursuit of self-satisfaction, self-indulgence and excess of luxury are normal.

&lt;!--more--&gt;Most people only associate Sodom and Gomorrah with sexual perversion. But listen to what God says brought down His wrath upon them.

&lt;strong&gt;Ezekiel 16.49,50 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good&lt;/strong&gt;

Beloved, the kingdom of God is not meat or drink or materialism. God did not make us to live for ourselves. He made us to have fellowship with Him and to live for His glory and bless others in His Name.

The gospel of the grace of God teaches us that all of life is now to be lived for the glory of The One Who has redeemed us and given us life.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 11.36 For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to Whom be glory for ever. Amen.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 43.7 Even every one that is called by My name: for I have created him for My glory,&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;I have formed him; yea, I have made him. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;profitable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;All things are lawful unto me.&lt;/strong&gt; Paul cites this slogan twice in this verse and twice in &lt;strong&gt;10:23&lt;/strong&gt;. Some suggest that this may have been a popular saying in liberal Corinth that was being used to excuse immoral behavior.

There were people in Corinth who were using this secular quotation to twist the true meaning of Christian liberty into license for sin, particularly in matters of a sexual nature. They false teachers interpreted Christian liberty as meaning that they had the right to do whatever they wished.

Liberal churches today have taken this saying out of its context to mean that now that we are under grace, we are free to indulge andlive however we want.

Keep in mind that Paul has just given a list of sinful behavior that if a person is doing them he will not inherit the Kingdom of God.

Paul tells us here that Christian liberty is limited by (1) the moral law of God, and also (2) by what is profitable (expedient) and to the edification of others.

&lt;strong&gt;I will not be brought under the power of anything. &lt;/strong&gt;The implication here is that sin does possess a power. But it is a power that enslaves and binds. Christian liberty is deliverance from sins power and bondage. As believers in Jesus Christ, we have been set free from being the slaves of any and all inordinate physical pleasure.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 9.24-27 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection:lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. &lt;/strong&gt;

The libertines in Corinthas some do todayargued that illicit sex (adultery and fornication) is as natural and necessary for the body as eating, and thus has no real bearing on ones spiritual life.

While it was normal and even acceptable for Corinthian men to have sex with the prostitutes of Aphrodite both inside and outside of the temple, Paul argued that this should no longer be the practice of the followers of Christ.

Among the things that Paul exhorted the Gentiles was to &lt;strong&gt;abstain from formication (Acts 15.20). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The body is not for fornication but for The Lord and The Lord for the body. &lt;/strong&gt;Paul responds by saying that the body belongs to God, and The Lord is for the body, thus, everything done with the body is relevant to the spiritual life. Therefore, dealing with sin means controlling our bodily appetites, affections and lusts.

The whole person, including the body, is meant to honor God. And Paul states here that this is particularly true in relation to sex, which God gave as a beautiful and loving gift when exercised according to his plan in a heterosexual relationship between a man and a woman in the sacred covenant of marriage.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 13.4 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.&lt;/strong&gt;

My precious brothers and sisters in Christ, write this Scripture on the hard drive of your heart and mind. &lt;strong&gt;The body is for the Lord!&lt;/strong&gt; Your body has been given to you for one reason: and every single part of your body is to be yielded unto God as an instrument for glorifying Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;6.14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by His own power.&lt;/strong&gt;

Because of Gods resurrection designs for the body, an indispensable identity exists between the present physical body and the future glorified body.

Now we see why a proper understanding of the doctrine of the bodily resurrection is so practical. The body is not just going to be destroyed; it is going to be raised. The body is not morally indifferent. It is for the glory of God.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.42-44 It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Both the authority of the Seventh Commandment and the apostle's appeal to the Christian's sacredness as a member of the body of Christ forbid unequivocally immorality of every kind&lt;/em&gt;. C.I. Scofield

The doctrine of the believers union with Christ is one of the most fundamental teachings of the apostle. What is significant about this verse is that it represents our union with Christ as an act of surrender of the whole person, not only the body&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 12.1,2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 5.23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Corinthians were wrong in thinking that sexual union with a temple prostitute did not affect their relationship with Christ.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. &lt;/strong&gt;

The scriptures place sexuality as a supreme physical expression of relational oneness. That is why it is to be reserved for the unique oneness that God has ordained in a marriage bond. Here Paul uses &lt;strong&gt;Genesis 2:24&lt;/strong&gt; to support his case.

&lt;strong&gt;6.17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;He who us joined unto The Lord&lt;/strong&gt;- No words, could more powerfully express the closeness and intimacy of the union that exists between Jesus Christ and His faithful disciples.

Union with Christ makes the Christians body a sacred object, destined for resurrection and glory, as we will see in &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15&lt;/strong&gt;, Lord willing.

&lt;strong&gt;6.18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Flee&lt;/strong&gt; is in the present tense and it indicates that the Christian must deliberately and repeatedly avoid situations that might tempt him or her to defy God in this way.

&lt;strong&gt;Flee:&lt;/strong&gt;do not stop to reason about it or think of it. It means to turn from it with detestation, and occupy your mind with things that are right and good.

The good biblical example of fleeing is Joseph running away from the advances of Potiphars wife (&lt;strong&gt;Gen. 39:12&lt;/strong&gt;). He gained everything that he lost.

The bad example of not fleeing is David lusting after Bathsheba and pursuing her. He lost everything that he gained. Need I say more?

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 13.14&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 2.11 Abstain from fleshly lusts that war against the soul. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;6.19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? &lt;/strong&gt;

When God bought us, He bought us to be dwellings of His Holy Spirit. He redeemed us to fill our lives with Him! &lt;strong&gt;Filled with all the fullness of God&lt;/strong&gt; as the apostle Paul says (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%203.19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 3:19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;6.20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;You are bought with a price (Mt 20:28; Ac 20:28; Ga 3:13; Heb 9:12; 1Pe 1:18, 19; 2Pe 2:1; Re 5:9). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1:18, 19 Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish, and without spot. &lt;/strong&gt;

As a redeemed sinner, my body is no longer to be self- governing or self- sustaining, because it now belongs to the Lord and is to be used for His purposes and honor.

The body of the Christian man or woman, regardless of how young or old they are, married or single belongs to Jesus Christ.

My sexual organs belong to The Lord, my eyes belong to The Lord, my ears belong to The Lord, my mouth belongs to The Lord, my mind belongs to The Lord, my hands belong to The Lord, my feet belong to The Lord.Get the idea? The purpose of our bodies is to bring glory to God.

&lt;strong&gt; 1 Corinthians 10.31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.7-9 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.&lt;/strong&gt;

We t redeemed to live for Christ and the glory of The Father. Gods glory, not selfishness and self pleasure is to be the chief aim of our lives today saints.

&lt;u&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/u&gt;

There is a sense of urgency and concern in this epistle, isnt there? Pauls heart and mind are broken and deeply concerned about the spiritual condition and validity of conversion of some of the people here at Corinth.

I see Paul weeping over Corinth in the same way that Jesus wept over the city of Jerusalem.

In spite of their professed faith in Jesus Christ, instead of pursuing holiness and purity in the fear of God, they were driven by their fleshly and bodily lusts and desires.

Instead of feeding their inner with the word of God and prayer, they were feeding their bodily lusts and sensual desires and in the process, quenching and starving The Spirit of God. They were living like the deceived Israelites to whom Jesus wrote:

&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 2.13,14 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.&lt;/strong&gt;

Note that The Lord calls the forsaking of Him in favor of the pursuit of something else evil and broken. Paul was concerned because he saw them living in the vice grips and death throes of self centered living. They certainly were not living according to the words of Paul, &lt;strong&gt;for me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. &lt;/strong&gt;

Like Corinth, the church today is living in the midst of a very self indulgent and promiscuous society. Have you adopted the fallen mores of society instead of the Holy Word of God?

Do you think you are beyond the possibility of making shipwreck of your faith? Are you in that shipwreck process this morning? How much leaven leavens the entire lump? How much laziness causes spiritual erosion?

Where do you think backsliders and apostates come from? They come from people who, little by little, ignored the voice of God in their own conscience, and in doing so, became hardened in their heart to both to the danger and deceitfulness of sin.

Are you in the race to win the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus? If you said yes, then it is important that you do not get hindered or overloaded with anything that would impede your progress toward the goal. If you were in the hundred-meter dash in the Olympics, you would not line up in the blocks with a heavy pair of hiking boots and a backpack on, would you?

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 12.1,2 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Beloved, each one of us have a race to run. We should therefore strip ourselves of everything that may hinder us. Please note here that there is a distinction made between weights and sin. This means that there are some things which, though not sins, we as Christians should avoid, since they are hindrances to our growing in Christ and the knowledge of Him.

Have you received the grace of God in the Person of His Son Jesus Christ?

&lt;strong&gt;John 1.10-13 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Jews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

When we receive Jesus Christ as Savior, we do not make Him Lord, we receive Him as Lord. Will you receive Him as your Lord this morning?

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>In this section of the epistle to the Romans, the implications of justification by grace through faith in chapters 1-4 are now drawn out.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The transition from wrath (Ro 1:18) to grace (Ro 3:21) transforms both the status and the experience of the believer. Instead of estrangement (Ro 3:10-17) there is now peace (Ro 5:1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the place of falling short of Gods glory through sin (Ro 3:23), there is the hope of glory (Ro 5:2).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Instead of suffering as judgment (Ro 2:5, Ro 2:6), there is joy in tribulation because of what God produces through it (Ro 5:3).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Instead of fearful uncertainty, there is assurance of Gods love (vv. 6-8) and joy in Him (v. 11).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Thus, the gospel of grace means that our reconciliation with God depends solely upon the work of Christ. But this reconciliation with God is communicated to us by the gospel; for the proclamation of the gospel is the means whereby we are &lt;em&gt;drawn&lt;/em&gt; to Christ and &lt;em&gt;come&lt;/em&gt; to Him.

&lt;strong&gt;Ro 5:1 Therefore (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; connects Pauls present argument with what he has already said&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) being justified (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;acquitted, declared righteous&lt;/em&gt;...legal terms&lt;strong&gt;) by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:&lt;/strong&gt;

Faith joins believers to Jesus Christ, the second Adam. Since chapter three, Paul has been talking about justification by faith, how that God has declares the person who has placed faith in The crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ innocent of all sin charges &lt;em&gt;because of&lt;/em&gt; their faith in Jesus Christ.

By faith in Jesus I mean believing that (1) He took &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of my sin; (2) believing that He rose again from the dead. If you believe on Him Who sent Jesus to die for your sins and rose again from the dead, you are &lt;strong&gt;justified (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;just as if I never did it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;

Now if I were justified by works then I would have peace with God as long as I was doing good. But when I failed that peace would again be broken. Thats the failure of man made religion, which is always works and ritual based instead of grace and faith based.

Please note that &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; we are born again, there is a change in our standing before God, we are now &lt;strong&gt;justified&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is all a work of Gods grace.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Nobody is born in this justified state&lt;/em&gt;....you may have been raised in a Christian home, but that does not make you a Christian, and that is simply because &lt;em&gt;God doesnt have grandchildren&lt;/em&gt;, He only has children

I am &lt;em&gt;not justified&lt;/em&gt; in the eyes of God until I am born again, and I am not born again until I (1) repent of my sin (2) trust in Jesus Christ for the remission of my sin (3) confess Him before men as Lord.

The first benefit of being &lt;strong&gt;justified by faith &lt;/strong&gt;is that &lt;strong&gt;we have peace with God&lt;/strong&gt;.

The enmity that characterizes the relationship between God and His sinful, rebellious creatures is ended for those who are justified through faith by faith in Jesus Christ

When we realize that &lt;strong&gt;peace with God&lt;/strong&gt; is a free gift by grace through faith, it frees us from the vicious cycle of trying to establish peace with God upon the basis of my own efforts.

Peace with God is the first fruit of our justification. The rebellion is over. Reconciliation is won. This peace is not a guarded truce subject to new warfare. It is a permanent peace because it is rooted and grounded in the Prince of Peace Himself, Jesus Christ, Who is our peace.

It is important to note that &lt;strong&gt;peace with God &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; the same as &lt;em&gt;peace &lt;u&gt;of&lt;/u&gt; God &lt;/em&gt;spoken of in other places (such as Philippians 4:7). This is peace &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; God; the battle between God and us is &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt; - and He won, winning us.

Peace &lt;em&gt;of &lt;/em&gt;God is the assurance that God is in control of and working out all things in my life for good in my life. Thus peace is not in my circumstances or my feelings, but in Christ and His presence and promises.

&lt;strong&gt;John 14.27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 16.33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, &lt;/strong&gt;

Not only do we have &lt;strong&gt;peace with God through faith in Jesus Christ, &lt;/strong&gt;we also have &lt;strong&gt;access by faith into this grace wherein we stand. &lt;/strong&gt;With peace established, we now have &lt;strong&gt;access&lt;/strong&gt; to Gods presence. The wall of partition has been removed.

The Greek word for &lt;strong&gt;access &lt;/strong&gt;here means, &lt;em&gt;ushering someone into the presence of royalty&lt;/em&gt;.

However, in later Greek, it is the word for the place where ships come in to find refuge during a storm at sea, a harbor or a haven.

In other words, it is by the grace of Jesus Christ that we have been &lt;em&gt;ushered into the presence of God where we have found a safe harbor from the turbulent storms of life&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;That friendly relation with God whereby we are acceptable to Him and have assurance that He is favorably disposed towards us &lt;/em&gt;Thayer

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 3:12 In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.&lt;/strong&gt;

Loved ones, The Lords Supper this morning reminds us that through Christ, our glorious Mediator and High Priest, you and I have the privilege of walking into the presence of Almighty God. Let me tell you what this means.

When life is falling apart, &lt;em&gt;we have access to God&lt;/em&gt;; when despair hits home, &lt;em&gt;we have access to God&lt;/em&gt;; when things are wonderful, &lt;em&gt;we have access to God&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;It is by faith &lt;/strong&gt;that we firmly and safely &lt;strong&gt;stand in this &lt;/strong&gt;marvelous &lt;strong&gt;grace of God.&lt;/strong&gt; And because it is by the grace of God that we have this access to Him, we know that the door is always open.

Satan troubles us constantly by claiming that the door is closed. "God doesnt want you to come. You failed to be righteous." However, my righteousness and access to The father is based on my faith in Jesus Christ. The door is never closed to us, even after Ive been a miserable failure. In fact, if there is a time that we need that door to God open is when we have failed or sinned.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 4:15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as &lt;em&gt;we are, yet&lt;/em&gt; without sin. 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. &lt;/strong&gt;

Note also that our faith is something that we &lt;strong&gt;stand &lt;/strong&gt;in. We have a &lt;em&gt;standing&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;grace&lt;/strong&gt;.

Saving faith is a standing faith, it is a fixed position that sinks deep into the heart, and endures through life. It &lt;em&gt;is not a changeable persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, only for one day or for a season in ones life.

&lt;strong&gt;and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Before we are saved, we &lt;strong&gt;fall short of the glory of God; &lt;/strong&gt;now that we are in Christ, we &lt;strong&gt;rejoice in the hope of the glory of God! &lt;/strong&gt;What an incredible transformation God has wrought in our hearts.

&lt;strong&gt;3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;&lt;/strong&gt;

Gr. for tribulations &lt;em&gt;describes the process of crushing an olive with heavy rocks in order to extract oil&lt;/em&gt;. Jon Courson

The word tribulations refers to all kinds of troubles and difficulties that may affect our lives. This includes such things as the pressures of school or jobs, family situations, financial or physical needs, tragic circumstances, sorrow, sickness, persecution, mistreatment or loneliness.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 14:22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

Some would say that Paul has lost his mind here. How can a person glory in difficult times? Hardships? Outside of Christ, you cant. But in Christ, we can glory because we know that He is there with us and for us during our times of despair and sorrow.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 1.3,4 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

I can glory in hard times because God comforts me in my tribulations and I also know that &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.28 all things work together for good to those that love God to those who are the called according to His purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;

Actually, Paul is headed in that direction because when we get to the last section of &lt;strong&gt;Rom 8.18 &lt;/strong&gt;through the end of the chapter, he is going to remind us that even &lt;strong&gt;tribulation&lt;/strong&gt; can never separate us from the love of God.

&lt;strong&gt;James 1:2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, 1:3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces patience.&lt;/strong&gt;

The KJV renders the word &lt;strong&gt;temptations &lt;/strong&gt;instead of trials. Why? What God will allow in your life as a trial to strengthen our faith, Satan will seek to exploit to draw us into a mindset of hopelessness, doubt and despair.

And what purpose does tribulations serve? To develop &lt;strong&gt;patience. &lt;/strong&gt;

God does not try us to discover more &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; us, but that we might learn a whole lot more about how weak we are apart from Him.

One sure ingredient for spiritual maturity is the testing of our faith in the fires of adversity. Our faith is made purified as we learn to lean upon The Lord and His strength. We are taught to have &lt;strong&gt;no confidence in the flesh. &lt;/strong&gt;

Patience is the fruit of The Spirit that enables me to walk by faith as I wait upon The Lord to manifest His presence and purpose in the situation.

&lt;strong&gt;4 And patience, experience; &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word for experience here is &lt;em&gt;dokime&lt;/em&gt;. Dokime is used of metal which has been passed through the fire so that everything base has been purged out of it.

What &lt;strong&gt;experience&lt;/strong&gt; does &lt;strong&gt;patience&lt;/strong&gt; develop? The testimony that God is faithful. As I wait upon God, I experience the work of God in my life.

The fiery trials of our faith are allowed by God in our lives to purge us of our fleshly desires or any trust in the arm of the flesh (&lt;strong&gt;Jer 17.3&lt;/strong&gt;).

By waiting and trusting in The Lord, instead of myself or my ability to work the situation out; my faith is strenghtened and I come out of the fiery furnace more Christ like than before I went in.

When the difficulties in our lives are met with patience, the outcome is another experience of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. My experience in Christ has taught me over the years to say &lt;strong&gt;God is good, &lt;/strong&gt;and despite what circumstances tell me, &lt;strong&gt;All things are working together for good.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;and experience, hope:&lt;/strong&gt;

True Biblical hope is not wishful thinking about something good that might happen in the future. It is a confidence from God concerning His promises, which makes it sure and leaves no room for doubt, because it is based on His character.

Experience in The Lord keeps us from flipping out or freaking out when life takes unexpected turns, because the &lt;strong&gt;hope &lt;/strong&gt;that we have as Christians &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a worldly or temporal hope.

As a Christian, I can live in reality. I realize that the world is corrupt. I do not have to live a life of denial. Sin has brought into this world suffering, pain and physical death, but in Christ Jesus, we have a living hope.

Because I have a hope in Jesus Christ I can face the reality of life. Jesus is coming again for me, and Jesus should call me home before the rapture of the church, I have the promise that He will usher me into the presence of the Father without a spot or blemish of sin.

&lt;strong&gt;5 And hope maketh not ashamed (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will never prove an illusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.&lt;/strong&gt;

When we trust and hope in The Lord Jesus Christ, we will never be ashamed. On the contrary, whenever I freak out and flip out and in so doing let my emotions or my flesh have the final say about situations, I find myself beginning to think and &lt;em&gt;speak&lt;/em&gt; and sometimes &lt;em&gt;act &lt;/em&gt;in ways that are very shameful and dishonoring to My Lord Jesus Christ.

It literally reads, &lt;strong&gt;the love of God&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;has been poured &lt;em&gt;into &lt;/em&gt;our hearts. &lt;/strong&gt;

Whatever God pours &lt;em&gt;into us&lt;/em&gt;, He intends that it be poured &lt;em&gt;out of us&lt;/em&gt;.

In Israel, the Dead Sea may be rich in minerals, but nothing can live in it. Why? There is no outlet. If your Christian life is all about learning and study (&lt;em&gt;which are both important and good&lt;/em&gt;), you may be rich in Bible knowledge, but you have not yet learned the secret of life in The Spirit.

There is another Sea in Israel, the Sea of Galilee that is rich with life. Why? There is both an inlet and an outlet. When we learn to &lt;em&gt;export&lt;/em&gt; what we &lt;em&gt;import&lt;/em&gt; from God, our lives will be rich and a blessing to others.

Gods love is &lt;strong&gt;shed abroad&lt;/strong&gt; when we are vessels that are being &lt;em&gt;poured out for His Names sake&lt;/em&gt;.

The more that the love of Jesus is poured out in this place; the more that the love of Jesus is being poured out on one another in this place, the more of the love of Jesus that The Holy Ghost will pour in.

Beloved, Jesus Christ made the essential meaning and purpose of life very clear when He said, &lt;strong&gt;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Luke 10.27,28&lt;/strong&gt;).

Beloved, my admonition to you who call KF your home church is simply this.&lt;strong&gt;keep yourselves in the love of God&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life (Jude 21).&lt;/strong&gt; Resist with a passion the fleshly temptation to harbor unloving thoughts, speak unloving words, or serve The Lord with unloving motives or attitudes.

&lt;u&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/u&gt;

The description of the love of God for sinners as is described in Romans 5.6-10 are filled with wonder that is beyond human comprehension.

The extent of God's love is shown in the fact that Christ died for men in whom there was nothing that evoked that love. Jesus died for the ungodly, and the unrighteousness, who were His enemies!

For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the good sweet, wonderful and generous kind people? No. To the praise of the glory of His grace, Jesus Christ died for the ungodly. Thats me today..thats you belovedthats you my friend.

Oh may the Holy Spirit take and stamp this truth, deep into each and every one of our hearts this morning as we take the bread and drink the cup.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 5.11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.&lt;/strong&gt;

Literally, the reconciliation, meaning "change." Through faith in Christ, God changes us from His enemies to His family.

Have you received the gift of eternal life through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ? Whosoever shall call upon The Name of The Lord shall</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Remember Paul wrotethis chapter when the church at Corinth was facing an unspecified time of moral and social upheaval and instability.Due to the ascetic false teachings regarding sexuality on one hand and the pressures of caving in to the flesh pleasing and fallen mores of the culture on the other, the people in Corinth were making knee jerk decisions that were contrary to The Spirit filled teaching of Paul.These decisions were creating chaos and disorder is their vocational and marital states.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christians were leaving their unsaved spouses to find a Christian spouse.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christians who were divorced were thinking that they needed to divorce their present spouse and return to their original spouse to get right with God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Married couples had stopped having sexual relationships with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jews were told that they needed to forsake their Jewishness and start living like a Gentile and Gentiles were being taught that they needed to be circumcised and live like a Jew in order to really be right with God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slaves were being told to flee their masters and claim their independence from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Corinthians had become a confused, restless, disoriented and discontented people.

Instead of following the clear and sound teaching of Gods Word, they were adopting either a cultic or cultural worldview of living as opposed to a biblical worldview. These same challenges confront us in the body of Christ today.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7.17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.&lt;/strong&gt;

The word &lt;strong&gt;but &lt;/strong&gt;is a connecting word. It is a continuation of what we looked into last Sunday morning about marriage and divorce and remarriage.

Should I stay married to this unbeliever? Should I divorce my 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; wife or husband and go back to my 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; wife or husband? Should I get married because I cannot hold back my sexual urges? Should I leave my master and seek freedom?

Verses 17,20 &amp;amp; 24 exhort the Corinthians to walk (serve The Lord) in whatever marital or vocational state they are.

By using the phrase, &lt;strong&gt;as God has&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;distributed, &lt;/strong&gt;Paul wanted them to recognize Gods sovereign and providential hand at in their lives.

These verses are a call for stability. A call for them to put an end to stop the bleeding caused by these unwise and unbiblical kinds of decisions. It was a call for them to repent of any sin in their past, but to move forward and walk in their present vocational and marital status.

We find the word called used 9 times and calling 1 time in this brief section of Scripture. What is the call of God? Is it some mysterious kind of a thing? Is it like being on a merry-go-round and hoping to catch the brass ring?

The calling and counsel of God in this section of Scripture is to remain in the vocation and marital state that they are in.

The issue is not about seeking to undo their sinful past. The issue is not about your present marital status. Whether you are a slave or freeman. Whether you are a Jew or a Gentile. But have you repented of your sinful past, and are you serving The Lord without distraction in whatever station in life you are in right now?

&lt;strong&gt;7.18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7.19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7.20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.&lt;/strong&gt;

Circumcision was a procedure that was done on Jewish boys in obedience to the Old Testament commandment. It was a physical sign of belonging to the people of God. In these verses Paul makes clear that if a person was converted as a Jew, he should be free to maintain this Jewish identity. Some were telling them to forsake their Jewishness to get right with God.

However, the Gentile who came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ should not feel the need to embrace circumcision or any other Jewish customs in an effort to be a better Christian as some Orthodox Jews were telling them.

In the eyes of God, circumcision or uncircumcision is no longer the issue. What then is the issue?

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6.14 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul's point isn't really about circumcision; that is just an example. Even as being circumcised or uncircumcised is irrelevant when it comes to serving God, so is your current marital state. He could just as easily say, and is saying by analogy, &lt;em&gt;Married is nothing and being unmarried is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters&lt;/em&gt;.

Ritual or marital status never takes the place of obedience. The Lord Jesus said, if a man loves Me, he will what?

&lt;strong&gt;John 14.15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.&lt;/strong&gt;

Obedience to Christ in your present vocational or marital state is the call of God upon every Christian man or woman, married or single, bond or free in this house of The Lord this morning. The important thing is to keep Gods commandments. Follow Christ. Serve Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;7.21 Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7.22 For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christs servant.&lt;/strong&gt;

It is estimated that about half of the Roman Empires population had the status of slaves. Slavery meant that you belonged to someone else. You were their property.

Slaves made up the majority of early Christians. Pauls guidance shouldnt be seen as an acceptance of the Roman system of slavery, but rather as a biblical approach and perspective in dealing with the difficulty of the situation.

&lt;strong&gt;If you may be free- &lt;/strong&gt;Paul encourages the believers to accept their status of slave, but if and when possible, pursue freedom within the conditions of the Roman Empire.

There is nothing wrong with seeking to pursue a better job or income in order to better provide for your family; provided that you are doing so prayerfully, and are obsessed with or dependent upon this change of job to be your source of security and happiness in your life.

My precious brothers and sisters in Christ, our only source of security, hope and happiness in life comes from The Lord, not man, regardless of our circumstances.

When the Lord called a slave to faith in the Lord, they became His servant in that condition. And when God called free people to faith in The Lord, they become the servants of Christ in that condition. In other words, whatever their lot in life, they were called by God to be His servant and bring Him glory.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 6.1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the Name of God and His doctrine be not blasphemed.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 6.5-8 Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; not with eyeservice, as men- pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Lords freeman- &lt;/strong&gt;Paul shows here that the status of a person in the eyes of a fallen society has nothing to do with who we are in light of Gods Kingdom.

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 3.23,24 And whatsoever ye do (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;doctor, professor, truck driver, toll booth collector, stock clerk, store manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), do &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

If you are seeking your identity or value or contentment in life according to this fallen worlds system, you are playing right into the devils hand and are going to be a frustrated and discontented believer.

Beloved, seek your identity and worth in life by discovering who you are in Christ and seeking to make much of Him right where He plants you.

&lt;strong&gt;7.23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Be not servants of men- &lt;/strong&gt;The believers lifewhether free or slaveis not to be determined the pressure of a misguided, sinful, rebellious world, but because he or she has ben redeemed with the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

The highest calling that any human being can have in Gods universe is to be a servant of the Most High God and Savior Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;7.24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Be faithful to The Lord in whatever marital or vocational state you are in and leave you future in His hands.

When Paul says that we are to remain in the state that God has called us into, it should be obvious to you that he doesn't mean that we can continue in a sinful or compromising lifestyle or occupation once we are saved. Everything that is sinful must be forsaken.

If you are dealing drugs when God saves you, this does not mean that you are being called by God to remain dealing drugs. It doesnt mean that you play praise music in your house or apartment and hand out salvation tracks with your next sale of cocaine or pound of pot!

This doesnt mean that if when you got saved you were living with someone of the same sex or opposite sex that you stay in that state.

In both cases that I just mentioned, the right thing to do is to confess and repent of your sin and then align your life with the Word of God.

A believers vocational or marital status has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not they are abiding in Christ.

The popular notion that if we can change our circumstances it will enhance our spiritual development or growth in Christ is a myth and entirely unwarranted according to God. If you are not abiding in Christ where you are, any change of location or vocation or marital state will not change that.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Closing comments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Let us not forget the often overlooked statement made by Paul that underscores the reason for this admonition.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 7:29-31&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp; 35.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away. 35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. &lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus said that we are to &lt;strong&gt;watch and be ready &lt;/strong&gt;for His return. The most important issue for every person is our self-watchfulness in our devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.

If we are unmarried, we should give The Lord Jesus our undivided devotion. And if it be His will for me to marry, I will leave that desire in His hands.

If we are married, we should encourage each other to serve The Lord with gladness and give The Lord Jesus our undistracted devotion as a husband and wife.

&lt;strong&gt;Serve The Lord without distraction. &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, if you really believe that Jesus is coming again, then you must believe that His return is nearer than when you walked into this building this morning. And if you really believe that Jesus is coming soon, it is going to effect the way you use your time, your priorities in life, how you spend His money as a steward. If you really believe that Jesus is coming soon, you are going to be more excited about serving Jesus and getting the gospel out than following your favorite football team, baseball team, dress, shoes, car, hobby etc!!

Jesus Christ is coming again! Our primary focus and affection should be on the Lord and His kingdom.

May God grant to each one of us that our purpose in life would be the pursuit of deeper intimacy with Jesus Christ that leads to an ever-increasing devotion to Him and His cause in these days that remain before His coming. &lt;strong&gt;The time is short.attend upon The Lord without distraction&lt;/strong&gt;!

&amp;nbsp;

Some of you are at a crossroads in your life. The answer is not self improvement or a positive attitude. The answer is a new life.

Listen to these words of Jesus:

&lt;strong&gt;Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;

Born again may also mean born from above. Both are true and John intends that we understand both meanings. The idea is that just as we were born physically, so we need to be born spiritually. Such a birth requires the power of God.

All the religion or good works in the world cannot resolve our basic problem of being alienated from God by sin. Thus, the only hope for any sinner to get right before God is by grace, through faith in the perfect, one time sacrifice for sin, forever, by The Lord Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 7.24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

The new birth is not something that I can do. Paul did not ask &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;could I deliver myself? Nor did he say &lt;em&gt;what &lt;/em&gt;do I need to do to deliver myself. He shouted out, who shall deliver me from this body of death?

The only answer for the emptiness within and the problem of sin is faith in Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;John 3.35,36 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus mentions two groups of people here this morning, and two different eternal destinies. Here are your two options my friend. Believe in Jesus Christ and live, or continue to reject Him and perish forever.

Trust in The One Who died for our sin and rose again from the dead for forgiveness of your sin. &lt;strong&gt;God is not willing that any should perish, but that all would come to repentance. &lt;/strong&gt;

Confess you sin and confess Jesus as Lord. Submit your life to Him as Lord and Savior.</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>It appears that the vast majority of the Corinthian church was a congregation of people that pushed the limits of grace and liberty to the edge.They were divided over favorite teachers.They were flaunting how tolerant they were of sexual sin. They were bringing one another to court to settle their differences and personal disputes.They were filled with pride and knowledge about idols. They considered it sheer nonsense that there was any danger in eating meat offered unto pagan gods. Instead of considering the convictions of others, they were stumbling both the church and the pagans by eating this meat in public.

We will see as we move on in the book that they were coming to the agape dinners drunk. Because of their unrepentant sin when coming to the Lord's Supper, many of them were sick and even died.They were misinterpreting grace and liberty big time. We do have Christian liberty, but our liberty is never to do something that is outside of the known the will of God.&lt;!--more--&gt;

So Paul writes to these saints a very pointed warning that in light of such questionable behavior, they should not claim assurance of salvation simply because they identified with Christ in their water baptism or took The Lords Supper.

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/147274541"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10.1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;forefathers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10.2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;And did all eat the same spiritual meat (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;);&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Moreover brethren &lt;/strong&gt;is a phrase that connects this section with the last verse of chapter 9.

&lt;strong&gt;I would not that ye should be ignorant. &lt;/strong&gt;When Paul writes that he did not want them to be ignorant, you can be sure that the brethren were ignorant or unaware of something he is going to explain to them.Ancient Israels 40- year journey between Egypt and Canaan is a sobering illustration of the misuse of freedom and the dangers of overconfidence.&lt;strong&gt;The cloud&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the sea&lt;/strong&gt; refer to two of the means that God used to deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and led through the wilderness&lt;strong&gt; (Ex. 13:1714:31). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Baptized unto Moses-&lt;/strong&gt; The Greek word baptize basically means to immerse. Paul is telling the Corinthians that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the Israelites who were under the cloud and passed through the sea were immersed or identified with Moses.In verses 1 and 2, Paul uses the word&lt;strong&gt; all &lt;/strong&gt;5 times.The Israelites passage through the waters is compared to Christian baptism, by which believers publicly identify with The Lord Jesus Christ.The miracles of the manna (&lt;strong&gt;Exodus 16:2.36&lt;/strong&gt;), quail (&lt;strong&gt;Numbers 11,4-34&lt;/strong&gt;) and the water from the rock are mentioned to describe the spiritual nourishment that God graciously and continually provided for His people during the wilderness wanderings.

It is to be noted that the incident of the rock appears at both the beginning of their desert wanderings&lt;strong&gt; (Ex. 17:17) &lt;/strong&gt;and near the end&lt;strong&gt; (Num. 20:213). &lt;/strong&gt;The smitten Rock is a type of Christs one sacrifice for sin.The Name &lt;strong&gt;Rock &lt;/strong&gt;is a common OT name for God&lt;strong&gt; (Deut. 32:4). &lt;/strong&gt;Paul intentionally uses the word Rock to speak of Jesus Christ. This is another one of the numerous proof texts of The Deity of Jesus Christ.

What we see here is that Jesus Christ is central to all of redemptive history. The volume of the book speaks of Christ. The birth of Jesus was an incarnation, not His beginning.Jesus Christ was behind the miraculous source of manna, quail and water in the wilderness.

&lt;strong&gt;10.5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.&lt;/strong&gt;

Though &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; were under the cloud and &lt;strong&gt;all &lt;/strong&gt;passed through the sea, &lt;strong&gt;with many of them, God was not well pleased. &lt;/strong&gt;Of the adults who came out of Egypt, only Caleb and Joshua were allowed to enter Canaan (&lt;strong&gt;Numbers 14.24-35&lt;/strong&gt;).Though God by His sustained Israels and in spite of the fact that they witnesses remarkable miracles, they failed to obey God, thus incurring His displeasure.

In verses 6-11, Paul parallels the events in Israels early history to the current situation in the Corinthians church. He warns them about &lt;strong&gt;idolatery (vs.7). Sexually immorality&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;vs. 8&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Testing Christ&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;vs. 9&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Murmuring and complaining&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;vs.10 &lt;/strong&gt;).

&lt;strong&gt;10.6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.&lt;/strong&gt;

All that happened to Israel serves as an example, howbeit a bad one. They were recorded as warnings that we should not set our hearts on evil things as they did.

When it says that they&lt;strong&gt; lusted after evil things. &lt;/strong&gt;What were those things?

&lt;strong&gt;***Numbers 11:46 And the mixed multitude that was among them fell alusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. &lt;/strong&gt;

If you ask the question what could possibly be wrong with wanting leeks, onions and garlic, you are asking the wrong question. The point is that they were asking for these things because they were not satisfied with the manna that God provided. Manna is not only a type of Christ, the Bread of God. It is also a type of the Scripture.

By lusting for these other things they were essentially questioning the provision of God and saying that Christ was not enough for them.

God sent so many quail their way that His people ate until they could eat no more. The psalmist sheds further light on this when he says, &lt;strong&gt;God gave them their request, but He sent leanness to their soul (Psalm 106:14, 15).&lt;/strong&gt; Thats always the way it is with lust. Lust is never satisfied; it always demands more than you fed it the last time, and eventaully brings leanness to the soul, weakness to the body, emptiness to the spirit.

Egypt is a type of the fallen world system. It is a type of the old life before we knew Jesus Christ. So what they were saying is that they were getting tired of the things of God, and wanted to go back to the things of the flesh.

Jesus Christ does not deliver us out of Egypt to put us back into Egypt. We are delivered from the kingdom of this world in order that we might be an ambassador of Jesus Christ in this world.

&lt;strong&gt;10.7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;indulge in pagan revelry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

Referring to the incident of when they worshipped the golden calf that was made by Aaron&lt;strong&gt; (Ex 32:16). &lt;/strong&gt;It was at that time that the people ate a ritual meal sacrificed to an idol.Keep in mind that some Corinthians insisted that it was their right to eat food that they knew was sacrificed unto idols.

What is an idol? An idol is anything in your life that you put in the place of God. It can be your spouse, your children, your grandchildren, your career, your 401k or your hobbies. It can be yourself.You may not have a Buddha on your mantel or a shrine in your homebut watch out that you dont allow a person, author, ministry, or book to represent God to you. Thats idolatry. Thats sin. Thats serious.

&lt;strong&gt;10.8 Neither let us commit fornication (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sexual immorality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.&lt;/strong&gt;

Refers to Israels participation in the worship of the Baal of Peor and the sexual practices associated with that worship &lt;strong&gt;(Nu 25:19).&lt;/strong&gt;Israelite men indulged in idolatry and sexual immorality with Moabite women, resulting in the death of thousands.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 15.28,29 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well, Fare ye well.&lt;/strong&gt;

Loose living is inconsistent with the testimony of Jesus Christ. We are called to live in purity and holiness, not fornication and sexual sin.

&lt;strong&gt;10.9 Neither let us tempt Christ (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;test The Lord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.&lt;/strong&gt;

Israel was discouraged and complained about the manna that God had given them, resulting in many of them being killed by poisonous snakes (&lt;strong&gt;Numbers 21.5,6&lt;/strong&gt;).Note, they tested the goodness of God, and were destroyed by serpents. The Corinthians needed to know that if they continued on that same path of tempting Christ, He would leave them in the power of the old serpent.But herein is the incredible grace of God. In &lt;strong&gt;Numbers 21-7-9, &lt;/strong&gt;we read that God in His grace provided a means of deliverance.

&lt;strong&gt;Numbers 21.7-9 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole:and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 3.14-17 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10.10 Neither murmur (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;grumble&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.&lt;/strong&gt;

Israel repeatedly grumbled and complained in the wilderness. Their grumbling and complaining about Moses and Aaron and the manna that God provided for them eventually destroyed them.

&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 2.14-16a Do all things without murmurings and disputings: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; Holding forth the word of life.&lt;/strong&gt;

Matthew Henry wrote: &lt;em&gt;Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes Him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. &lt;/em&gt;We are taught to be thankful unto God for Who He is and for all that He has done for us.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;10.11 Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.&lt;/strong&gt;

One of the purposes of Scripture is to warn us of the kinds of things that displease God and lead to destruction.

Paul writes that &lt;strong&gt;the ends of the world are come. &lt;/strong&gt;The First Coming of Christ, not His Second Coming, marks the ends of the ages. The Second Coming concludes what the first unfolds and will bring to accomplishment. We live in an overlap between the former and the new creation.

&lt;strong&gt;10.12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 16.18 Pride goes before destruction,and a haughty spirit before a fall.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Proverbs 28.14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief&lt;/strong&gt;

Apart from the grace of God, any one of us could fall today. Therefore, you and I need to be very careful that we stay in the realm of the will of God where we are not quenching the Spirit of God in our lives.A proper understanding of the grace of God will not cause a person to be lifted up with pride, self righteous and self-confident. It will humble them in the sight of The Lord.The Corinthians church must not allow their pride and sinful living to ignore these warnings of God.

&lt;strong&gt;10.13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it&lt;/strong&gt;

No matter what temptation you are experiencing right now beloved, there have been others who have had the same kind of temptation. We will never be free from temptation in this life. You can count on it. Thus, it is not temptation that is the problem. It is when we bite the bait and make provision for the flesh.

&lt;strong&gt;Temptation &lt;/strong&gt;in itself is not sin. Jesus was tempted&lt;strong&gt; (Mt 4:111). &lt;/strong&gt;Yielding to temptation is sin. The Greek for temptation and tempted can also mean testing and tested.Thus we must always bear in mind that while God permits testing for the purpose of strengthening faith and character, Satan entices to evil for the purpose of destruction.

Twoimportant facts about temptation in this verse:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The devil cannot use his demonic power to tempt you beyond what you are able to bear. The devil cannot make us sin. He can only attempt to get you to question the Word of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God is faithful. God does not set you up to cause you to sin. He will always provide a way of escape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Job 5.17,18 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he woundeth, and his hands make whole.&lt;/strong&gt;

Did God convict you of something today? Do you find pushing the grace and liberty of God to the edge? If so, it is now up to you to confess, repent and get back on track. He is faithful and just to forgive you and cleanse you.Throughout the text this morning, we saw how a proper interpretation and understanding of the Old Testament will always be centered on the redemptive purpose of Jesus Christ.Thus the Old Testament provides us with rich reminders that Gods Son has always been, and will always be, the only means by which sinners have access to Gods saving mercies.

Jesus Christ IS the gospel, my friend. I do not care who you are or what you have done. If you will repent of your sin and turn to Jesus Christ this morning, He will forgive you and give you a new heart. Christ is the only way for YOU to get right with God this morning my friend.

&lt;strong&gt;John 12.31,32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me. This He said, signifying what death He should die. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 3.16,17 For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved. &lt;/strong&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Pune, Paris and God&amp;#039;s Promise</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Revelation 21.4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things.

I am writing this at 36,000 feet, en route from Pune to Frankfurt, and hopefully home. In the midst of 3 weeks of conferences and intense bible study time with our KSOM students, reports flooded into India about the terrorist attacks that killed scores of people in Paris. Sadness, prayer and fears spread like wildfire in this nation, because many Muslims call India home. Pain and sorrow are universal emotions, whether one lives in India or France.

During this ordeal in Paris, pastors from big cities and rural villages gathered to worship The Lord and hear the teaching of The Word. The urgency of getting the gospel out was even more evident in light of current events. It was also during this trip that a beloved pastor/bible teacher went home to be with Jesus. I stood at his gravesite and saw the tears flow from his wife, son, family and friends. I thought, when will all this end? Nobody knows when, but we have the promise of God that it will.

Jesus Christ is both the gospel and only hope for mankind. When He returns, these former things will pass away. Until then, weep with those who weep, and rejoice with those who rejoice. Share the good news. That is Christ like gospel living.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Romans 8:28</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;

We begin our last study of the year 2015 by looking at the first 3 words, &lt;strong&gt;and we know. &lt;/strong&gt;The underlying idea behind these 3 words is that this is a truth that should be foundational in the life of every believer. We need to know this. It should be posted on our refrigerator. Put into our lunch box. It needs to be tucked away in our heart when things get hard.... life gets messy.... circumstances and emotions get out of control.

Even a casual glance at this verse tells us that all things dont work together for good for everybody. The promise that God will turn all things for good is not true in everybodys case.There are two things that need to be true for this promise to apply to you.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One is that you &lt;strong&gt;love God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Two is you are &lt;strong&gt;called according to His purpose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/150118378"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, who is this wonderful promise given to, beloved?

&lt;strong&gt;Those who love God&lt;/strong&gt;; Any god? No, those who love the True and Living God as revealed in the Holy Scriptures, and are &lt;strong&gt;the called according to His purpose&lt;/strong&gt;.

This love of God is what distinguishes true Christians from all other men and all other religions, for we alone are followers of The God Who became Man to take away our sins. We are worshippers of The God Who was crucified, buried, but has risen from the dead. Only born again believers refer to Jesus as &lt;strong&gt;My Lord and My God.&lt;/strong&gt;

So, in order to love God, you must first be born of The Spirit of God.

&lt;strong&gt; Rom 8.9 If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1Pe 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;u&gt;So what does it mean to love God? &lt;/u&gt;It means that when we are born again, The Father, Son and Holy Spirit becomes the object of our supreme delight, desire and joy.

&lt;strong&gt;Mark 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&lt;/strong&gt;

Loving The Lord is treasuring The Lord Jesus Himself more than anyone and anything. This means that Jesus is our first love.

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Luke 14:26 If any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.&lt;/strong&gt;

When we love The Lord we will most certainly appreciate and be thankful for the loved ones, friends and blessings that He brings into our lives.However, Jesus Christ will never become heavens currency for idolatry. God does not redeem us to share the throne of your heart with anyone or anything else.

Loving God is desiring Jesus Christ Himself more than His gifts. Loving God is treasuring Jesus Christ Himself more than His gifts. Love for God is delighting in Jesus Christ Himself beyond His gifts. Love for God is being satisfied in Jesus Christ Himself beyond His gifts. Love for God is cherishing Jesus Christ Himself beyond His gifts. Love for God is savoring Jesus Christ Himself beyond his gifts. Love for God is valuing God and prizing God and revering God and admiring God beyond His gifts.

We love our Lord Jesus supremely for Who He is; He is our Creator, our Shepherd, our Counselor, our Shield, our Redeemer, our strength and our song.When our love for The Lord Jesus is supreme, it is going to be demonstrated in a life that progressively lines up with the teaching of Gods Word.

&lt;strong&gt;1John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.&lt;/strong&gt;

This proof of loving Christ more than anyone and anything including ourselves is taken to the highest level with this command of Jesus given to you and me.

&lt;strong&gt;John 13:34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.&lt;/strong&gt;

So a love for The Lord is going to be demonstrated in a love for one another. In other words, we are going to have a loving relationship with all and any others who know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.In love we will serve one another, forgive one another, pray for one another, help one another, pray with one another, comfort one another, encourage one another etc.

The Spirit of God flows most powerfully in an atmosphere of love. What quenches the love of God? Bitterness, resentment, a hard heart that refuses to forgive. Beloved, to hold on to bitterness, resentment or a hard heart is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.

&lt;strong&gt;1 John 4.20,21 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also&lt;/strong&gt;

Not only loving The Lord, but also being &lt;strong&gt;called according to His purpose &lt;/strong&gt;is a vital part of knowing that all things work together for good.

I think it is important for us to underscore from our text in Romans that God does indeed have both a plan and a purpose for this universe and all things that He has created in it.

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 1:11 In whom (&lt;/strong&gt;that is The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;strong&gt;) also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things (&lt;/strong&gt;there is the same phrase &lt;strong&gt;all things&lt;/strong&gt; that we read in our text this morning&lt;strong&gt;) after the counsel of His own will:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 2.12,13 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. &lt;/strong&gt;

Just because I may not know what is going on in my life this morning, doesnt mean that God is just as mixed up as I am!

Peace is the calm assurance that what God is doing is best.

So, for those that &lt;strong&gt;love The Lord, and are the called according to His purpose&lt;/strong&gt;, what are some of the &lt;strong&gt;all things that work together for good&lt;/strong&gt;?

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So by peeking ahead into the context of the chapter, we can readily see that &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:28 &lt;/strong&gt;does not just mean all good things work together for good, it means &lt;strong&gt;all things&lt;/strong&gt;  including all the bad things.

In fact, the whole context before and after &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/strong&gt; is couched around suffering and groaning. But thats why is &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.28 &lt;/strong&gt;here guys!...it is here to encourage you and give you hope. That is why we read:

&lt;strong&gt;1Thessalonians 5:18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.&lt;/strong&gt;

Note again, in everything, not for everything.

From a purely human perspective, when you and I going through difficult or perplexing things like in &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.35, 36&lt;/strong&gt;, we are prone to challenge the wisdom of God like in the days of Ezekiel.

&lt;strong&gt;Ezekiel 18:25 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal (Heb. &lt;/strong&gt;fair and just&lt;strong&gt;). Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? &lt;/strong&gt;

Lit. Am I The One who is unfair, or is it you? Am I The One that doesnt see the eternal picture or is it you?

The ways of The Lord towards those who love Him are perfect. There is no flaw in His sovereignty. There is no flaw in His wisdom.

Life is life, both the good and the unpleasant parts, but above and beneath all of these things, our God is still on His throne. Jesus is by our side and will never leave us nor forsake us. He was right in the fiery furnace with the 3 Hebrew children...He wasnt standing on the outside cheering them on!!

In other words, when we know that it is Gods hand (not fate, not chance, not karma) that is invisibly but most decidedly working all things together for good, that allows me as a follower of Jesus Christ to face the personal afflictions, trials, persecutions and calamities to which I am exposed with the strength that comes from the Holy Spirit because I know that somehow, God is going to work all of these things together for good inasmuch as they fit into Gods eternal plan and purposes.

The Lord Jesus told the apostle Paul in &lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 12.9&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in your weaknesses. &lt;/strong&gt;

Let me repeat here, especially for the benefit of those here this morning with deep hurts and wounds, The Holy Spirit is not saying &lt;strong&gt;all things&lt;/strong&gt; you may be presently experiencing are good. He is saying God turns all things for good, as it was in the case with Joseph:

&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.&lt;/strong&gt;

This is an Old Testament version of &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/strong&gt;. All things work together for good for Gods people. God did not just watch evil events unfold with no design and no purpose, and then bring good out of them. No, just as Josephs brothers meant it (purposed it, designed it) for evil, so also God meant it (purposed it, designed it) for good.

For all of my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.28&lt;/strong&gt; is not only a source of great comfort. It is also a call to action. It is a battle cry. Since all things work together for my good, then I cannot be ultimately defeated as I purpose to walk in obedience to the revealed will or the call of God upon my life.

You can be sure that the devil will attempt to capitalize on your hardship or disappointments or personal failures and seek to wear you down. The devil wants you to feel sorry for yourself. The devil wants you to throw in the towel of life. The devil wants you to think what is the use of praying, reading The Word, coming to fellowship. Do not listen to his lies about God or what He is doing in your life.

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 6.12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.31If God be for us, who can be against us? &lt;/strong&gt;

In closing, I would only like to say that every message for believers is also a message for unbelievers. For believers, &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.28&lt;/strong&gt; aims to remind you of the unshakeable rock of providence that is the root of your faith this morning. The mighty hand of God is holding you up beloved!

For unbelievers, &lt;strong&gt;Romans 8.28 &lt;/strong&gt;is one of the many verses in the Bible that aims to win your heart to place faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.

Gods eternal purpose was His gracious design of saving a lost world by the death of his Son.&lt;strong&gt; Christ Jesus came into the world to die for sinners.&lt;/strong&gt; (you qualify believe me, and so do I).

Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sin and rose again the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; day. Jesus Himself gave this public invitation to a multitude,

&lt;strong&gt; Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&lt;/strong&gt;

How do I come to Christ? &lt;strong&gt;Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.&lt;/strong&gt; God calls and draws sinners like me to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ by bringing them into contact with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Then, by the power of The Holy Spirit, He awakens their dead hearts, and causes them to clearly see their desperate condition and hear the glorious gospel of salvation by grace through faith in Christ as being irresistibly true and beautiful.

Today is the day of salvation.

&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 55:6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.&lt;/strong&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The passages that we are looking into todayhave led some women to ask questions like, is God a sexist? Does God exalt men above women?Does the bible teach that God diminishes or demeans women? Why cant we pray Mother God instead of Our Father? Is the bible irrelevant in todays society?

This is one of those passages that must be understood culturally before we can apply biblical principles for today. The passages deal primarily with the issue of head coverings in public worship. A head covering for a woman in public worship was a sign of submission, respect and reverence for God-ordained headship and authority.

The matter of wearing hats or head coverings, although seemingly insignificant for us, was a critical problem in the ancient world, because the Jewish and Gentile backgrounds were colliding here in Corinth.

Pauls admonition in these Scriptures reveals a pastor's heart that desired to see God-ordained, God-glorifying order in the public worship service, as well as maintain a sense of unity amongst the brethren.

&lt;strong&gt;11.2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;traditions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), as I delivered them to you. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 11.1,2 &lt;/strong&gt;show us that Paul taught others twoways, by precept and by example. The most effective way of teaching is by example. The philosophy, do as I say but not as I do, is the gospel of the hypocrites.

The ordinances or &lt;strong&gt;traditions&lt;/strong&gt; that Paul &lt;strong&gt;delivered&lt;/strong&gt; to the Corinthian Christians were the oral teachings and practices of the apostles, as they received them from Jesus.

Keep in mind, beloved, that these oral teachings were vitally important at this point in time, because the followers of Christ had no written gospels, nor did they have many of Pauls letters as we do today.

There is a big difference between man-made, unbiblical traditions as those mentioned in &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 15&lt;/strong&gt;, and God- inspired, biblical traditions as those mentioned in &lt;strong&gt;2 Thessalonians 2:15&lt;/strong&gt;.

Other than the ordinances of water baptism and The Lords Supper, these oral teachings passed along the fundamental doctrines of the faith that were once delivered to the saints and matters of practical Christian living.

&lt;strong&gt;11.3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. &lt;/strong&gt;

With these words, Paul sets a foundation for his teaching in the rest of the chapter. Simply put, Paul makes it clear that God has established principles of headship, order, and authority.And the one word that he uses to identify this God ordained position of order and authority is the word &lt;strong&gt;head. &lt;/strong&gt;

In this verse, Paul identifies three relationships of God ordained headship: (1) Christ and man. (2) Man and woman (husband and wife). (3) Christ and God.The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of every individual man, just as the husband is the head of his wife and God The Father is the head of Christ.

Does The Father being Jesus Christs head mean that Jesus was lesser than God and inferior to the Father? No. &lt;strong&gt;Philippians 2&lt;/strong&gt; makes it clear that even though Jesus was God, He chose to subject and humble Himself before The Father as Son of God, Son of Man to accomplish the redemptive purposes of God. Jesus willingly, voluntarily, gladly submitted to the authority of the Father

As we work our way through these passages, we must keep in mind that in Jesus Christ,&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3.28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;em&gt;This verse does not deny that God has designed racial, social, and sexual distinctions among Christians, but it affirms that those do not imply spiritual inequality before God. Nor is this spiritual equality incompatible with the God- ordained roles of headship and submission in the church, society, and at home. &lt;/em&gt;John MacArthur

It is this principle of headship and submission to God ordained authority that is behind the subject of head coverings for women.

For the record, there are many men who only quote the middle part of verse 2, &lt;strong&gt;the head of the woman is the man.&lt;/strong&gt; They want nothing to do with laying down their lives and loving their wife like Christ loves the church or dwelling with them according to knowledge. It would be better to call those kind of men dictators and not husbands.

&lt;strong&gt;11.4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. &lt;/strong&gt;

If a man prayed or preached with his head covered, he would be out of order, because he would be, symbolically speaking be dishonoring his Head, The Lord Jesus Christ.

Why do we see Jewish men and all men standing at the Wailing Wall praying with a prayer shawl or some kind of head covering? When Moses came down from the mountain after he met with God, he covered his face with a veil to not reveal that his glory was fading. That gave birth to a Jewish tradition that Jewish men should cover their head when they approach God. In &lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 3, &lt;/strong&gt;former Rabbi Paul tells us that when a mans heart is turned to The Lord Jesus, the veil is removed.

&lt;strong&gt;11.5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. &lt;/strong&gt;

In the culture of Corinth, a womans covered head while ministering or worshiping was a symbol to signify a subordinate relationship to her husband. It was a symbol of her willful submission and respect for God-ordained order.If a woman had her head uncovered in a church service that would be dishonoring her husband as her head. It would be perceived as a sign of rebellion against her husband and her God.

Paul says that for her to not cover her head would be like shaving her head. Keep in mind that in that day, only a prostitute or radical feminist would shave their head. Thus we see that failing to honor God ordained headship and authority is a moral issue.

The corresponding symbol of head covering for a woman today in our culture would be for a wife to wear a wedding ring.It is not my intention to start WW3 todayat church, but what would possibly be the reason for any married man or woman to not wear a wedding ring?In our culture, when you see a person without a wedding ring on, what message does that send to you? That tells me that they are not married. When a man or a woman takes off their wedding ring before they go on a business trip or on a night out with the boys or the girls, what are they saying?

&lt;strong&gt;11.7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 11.8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. &lt;/strong&gt;

Verses 7-11 can be summed up this way:

(1) A man ought not to cover his head, for he represents the very person and glory of God, while the woman reflects the person and glory of the man.

(2) Man does not exist because woman exists, but vice versa. Man was not created originally for the sake of woman, but woman was created for the sake of man.

(3) For this reason a woman ought to bear on her head an outward sign of mans authority for all the angels to see.

Why &lt;strong&gt;because of angels? &lt;/strong&gt;While we cannot be dogmatic about what this means, let me give you something to ponder.

According to &lt;strong&gt;Job 38:4, 7, &lt;/strong&gt;the angels were present at creation, when God designed the order of authority for men and women. Angels are very order conscious.Therefore, the covering on the head of a woman who is praying or prophesying in the congregation &lt;em&gt;could have &lt;/em&gt;sent a message to the angels that she was not immoral and out of order, but that she is under the authority of her husband.

&lt;strong&gt;11.11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

In the creation account, Eve was created by God to be Adams helpmeet. But since then, no man comes into this world except by a woman. Thus, both man and woman owe their existence and subjection to God.

Ladies, when you read in the Genesis account that God created you to be your husbands helpmeet, please do not think Hamburger Helper. To be a helpmeet meant that you were created by God to come alongside of your husband to help complete him. It was not good for Adam to be alone.

In both the created and redemptive order as well, both man and woman were created to live under the headship and authority of Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 1.18 And He is the head of the body, the church: Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 1.22,23 And hath put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul does not deny that the woman was equally made in Gods image (&lt;strong&gt;Gen. 1:27&lt;/strong&gt;). He appeals to the creation order to reiterate that male headship in marriage continues through all generations, though some cultural expressions of that principle of headship (e. g., that women should wear head coverings) may vary.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? &lt;/strong&gt;(The answer would be no).

&lt;strong&gt;11.14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. &lt;/strong&gt;

In talking about length of hair, Paul is saying that believers should look and behave in ways that are honorable in their own culture.In some cultures, long hair on men is considered appropriate and masculine.In Corinth, long hair was thought to be a sign of male prostitution in the pagan temples.And women with short hair were labeled prostitutes. Thus, length of hair for a man was a shame.

So Paul was saying that in the Corinthian culture, Christian women should keep their hair long. Becauseshort hair on women was a sign of prostitution, then a Christian woman would not want to have short hair because she would not want to project herself as an immoral or loose woman.Her insistence on having short hair would cause others to find it difficult to take her avowed love and witness for Jesus Christ seriously.To have short hair would mean that she was a morally loose woman who was available for sexual purposes.

My dear sisters in Christ, if you do not believe that dressing provocatively is sending a bad message to the opposite sex, you are either nave or on the prowl.The Puritans said that if it was sin for a man to lust after a woman (an it is), it was more sinful for a woman to dress in a way that would provoke a man to lust after her.

Keep in mind, beloved, that Corinth was one of the most licentious and promiscuous cities in the world. Paul's point of view was that in such an immoral climate, it was far better for the church to err on the side of being too modest and conservative rather than to do anything that might borderline immodesty or displays a lack of reverence for God and the sacred institution of marriage.

&lt;strong&gt;11.16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul is not saying that if a person disagrees with these God-ordained principles of headship, reverence, submission and modesty, it is no big deal.He is saying that in the church of The Lord Jesus Christ, any such teaching from those who disagree with the Bibles teaching on headship, modesty, reverence and respect for God ordained authority are to be rejected.

&lt;u&gt;Practical Lessons for us&lt;/u&gt;

Respect for and submission to God ordained headship, order and authority are vital to the health and well being of the family.

There is a serious absence of Godly reverence and respect for God ordained authority today not only in society, but in the family, and the consequences of rebellion are evident all across our land.

There are many Christian women who regard the God ordained headship of their husband as out of step with the times and no longer relevant. When Eve is the head of the home and not Adam, what you are left with the Addams Family.

There are many sons and daughters who no longer believe that they need to regard the biblical command to honor your father and mother.

&lt;u&gt;God ordained distinctions of genders &lt;/u&gt;

There is a gender revolution in our society. Society wants us to believe that there is no difference at all between men and women.One of the crystal clear teaching throughout Scripture is the importance of maintaining God ordained gender distinctions.Men are not women and women are not men. Men and women are physiologically different.

&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 5.1,2 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Deut 22.6 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.&lt;/strong&gt;

Transvestism,also called cross-dressing,or the practice of wearing the clothes of the opposite sex was common in the ancient world and many of the pagan religious rituals. There is nothing new under the sun.

&lt;strong&gt;Deut 22.6&lt;/strong&gt;is not a statement about clothing styles. Its not the clothing style that offends God, but using the style to act out a different sex role. God had a purpose in making us uniquely male and female. When a man begins to act and dress like a woman and a woman begins to act and dress like a man, that is a tragic disorder of how God created them.The distinction of genders was established at creation and is to be maintained in all spheres of life. We should celebrate our gender differences, not blur them or fight against them.

May the love of God, and the power of the gospel by grace, through faith in His Son Jesus Christ, set us free from any and all inversions or perversion of God ordained headship and authority for His glory and Namesake.

God told Hezekiah to set his house in order.Lord Jesus, set our homes and this portion of your body according to Your God-ordained order and design.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The Lords Supper is an ordinance of the church that is meant to be a visible representation of the death of Christ as the once and for all sacrifice for our sins. When we observe The Lords Supper, oftentimes the emphasis placed upon &lt;em&gt;the process&lt;/em&gt; of Jesus death rather than on &lt;em&gt;the purpose&lt;/em&gt; for His death.

Yes, there was an almost indescribable pain and suffering that Jesus went through for us. We should never minimize the suffering that Jesus endured for our sin.

But I believe that what The Father wants us to remember is that because of the finished work of the Cross, weve been miraculously and gloriously totally set free from the power and penalty of sin.

&amp;nbsp;

Scripture tells us that when we partake of The Lords Supper, it is also meant to be a demonstration of the oneness that we have as Christians in The Lord Jesus.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 10.16,17 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. &lt;/strong&gt;

The world back then, like our world today, was very rigidly divided. The early Church was the one and only place in the entire ancient world where the barriers that divided people were broken down.

In the church there were the free men and there were slaves. There were the Greeks and there were the people who did not speak Greek, who were called barbarians. There were the Jews and there were Gentiles. There were there were the cultured and the ignorant. There were the rich and there were the poor. Because of Jesus Christ, the Church was the one and only place where all men could and did come together.

The church was a hospital where all sinners who had been burned or hurt by the world, their own sin or the devil could find hope and healing in Jesus Christ.

One of the early church traditions was the eating of a common meal before they observed The Lords Supper. It was similar to what we would call an agape dinner. Everyone would bring a dish to pass to share with others before they took The Lords Supper. It was a time for these various groups of people to come together and share a common meal with one another.

But in the Church at Corinth, things had gone sadly wrong with the Love Feast. In the Church there were the haves and the have nots. There were those who could bring plenty of food and drink, and there were slaves who could bring hardly anything at all. In fact for many a poor slave the Love Feast must have been the only decent meal in the whole week. But in Corinth, the love of many was waxing cold. The rich did not share their food with the poor. The different house groups kept to themselves and ignored or despised those who did not meet with them.

The result was that the very meal at which the social, economic and even theological differences between members of the Church should have been obliterated only succeeded in aggravating these same differences. It was a disaster.

This loveless, selfish attitude was met with a from rebuke by Paul,

&lt;strong&gt;11.17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;your meetings do more harm than good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gr. schismata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) among you; and I partly believe it. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.19 For there must be also heresies (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gr. haireseis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) among you, that they which are approved (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;genuine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) may be made manifest among you. &lt;/strong&gt;

The words &lt;strong&gt;come together &lt;/strong&gt;found here in verses 17 and 18 speak of the corporate assembling of the saints for a time of corporate worship, instruction from Gods Word and fellowship.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 10.25 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;; but exhorting &lt;em&gt;one another&lt;/em&gt;: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.&lt;/strong&gt;

God has designed within all cultures the call for corporate gatherings of His people for worship, the hearing of Gods word, prayers and fellowship. These assemblies are meant to be for our good and His glory.

Today should be a time when we lift our hands and our voice to God in worship. Today should be a time when we hear and embrace Gods Word as it is being taught. Today should be a time when we pray with one another and for one another. Today should a time when use our spiritual gifts and resources to reach out to one another in love.

TV church is fine if you are sick or in the hospital, or working on Sunday. But TV church is not coming together in The Name of The Lord. Listening to our favorite bible teachers and singing along with K-Love or any other radio station during the week &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; coming together as a body.

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, Paul is grieved by what he hears about their conduct when they gathered together to eat the common meal before they observed The Lords Supper.

Two other times Paul is concerned about what he hears about the church at Corinth.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 1.11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 5.1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.&lt;/strong&gt;

It is a tragic thing indeed when The Name of Christ and His gospel is spoken against because it is commonly reported that there is sexual immorality and division and dissension amongst those professing to be united with Jesus by faith.

The first problem Paul mentions with regard to the agape dinner and The Lords Supper is the same problem that he addressed at the very outset of his letter: division and dissension. He calls this divisive, party spirit a sign of spiritual immaturity and carnal.

Even when they were coming together to eat the agape dinner and celebrate the Lords Supper, the Corinthian church was splintered into factions. You could cut the tension in the air with a knife.

Many interpreters believe that these divisions were caused by rivalries that had developed among the various Corinthian house churches that we read about in chapters 1 and 3. These house meetings you remember rallied more around their favorite teacher than they did Jesus Christ.

It is interesting that Paul identifies these groups as &lt;strong&gt;divisions&lt;/strong&gt; in verse 18, &lt;strong&gt;heresies&lt;/strong&gt; in verse 19. Both of these words are found in &lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5.19-21&lt;/strong&gt; and they are listed amongst the works of the flesh along with adultery, sexual immorality and idolatry.

It is a very serious matter to cause division among Gods people. One of the things that God hates is when a person sows discord and division among the brethren. Paul instructed the church to warn a divisive person twice and then reject him if he does not repent (&lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:911&lt;/strong&gt;).

Spiritual unity is at the very heart of the Christian faith and the life of Christs church. &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 4.3 &lt;/strong&gt;tells us to endeavor, or be eager to keep the unity of The Spirit in the bond of peace.

The only good thing that Paul finds about this sad situation is that over time, God revealed those who were genuine followers of Jesus Christ and those who werent.

&lt;strong&gt;11.20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. 11.21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If they intended to selfishly indulge themselves, they might as well have stayed at home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not&lt;/strong&gt;

We learned in chapter 1 that the church of Corinth was made up largely of the poorer class, including slaves.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 1:2628 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the educated elite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), not many mighty (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;influential&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), not many noble (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;those from aristocratic families&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;uneducated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no influence or power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;considered as being without merit or worth in this world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;absolute nothings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), to bring to nought things that are (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;those who are highly esteemed, well educated and influential&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): That no flesh should glory in his presence. &lt;/strong&gt;

Most of the church did not belong to what we would call, the upper class. They were the blue-collar people of our day.

The agape feast was a time when all believers were supposed to share their meals in a common place after which they would partake of the Lords Supper together&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;

However, when the Corinthians came together for their fellowship meals before eating the Lords Supper, some of the members separated themselves by house groups and social classes, and ate their meals separately. Some were even bringing their own bottle to church and getting drunk at church before taking communion.

The poor, who could not contribute much, if anything to the meal, were often ignored, despised and left hungry.

Jude tells us tat these individuals were stains on those love feasts. They were irreverent and cared only for themselves.

This carnal and holier than thou attitude of some of the members at Corinth was a total misrepresentation of the unity and love of Christ that should exist among all members in the body of Christ.

Paul condemned these actions and as we will see next week Lord willing, he is going to point out some serious consequences of not discerning The Lords Supper properly and remind them of the real purpose of the Lords Supper.

&lt;u&gt;Practical Application&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;No caste system in the body of Christ&lt;/u&gt;

A church where social and class distinctions exist is no true church at all. A real church is a body of men and women united to each other because all are united to Christ.

A church is no true church if the art of giving and sharing is forgotten. The true Christian cannot bear to have too much while others have too little. It is more blessed to give, than to receive. A genuine follower of Jesus Christ finds his greatest joy in sharing and giving to others for the glory of God.

Social, economic pride and cultural narrowness cannot coexist with the gospel of grace. They are mutually exclusive.

&lt;strong&gt;James 2.1-5 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts. &lt;/strong&gt;

Though God does indeed call us to discern and to discriminate between good and evil. Discrimination that is based on mere externals such as economic status, racial or ethnic differences, and the like is considered an evil form of judgment that has no place at all in the body of Christ. It is contrary to the character of God Who is no respecter of persons.

&lt;u&gt;Many denominations, one body of Christ&lt;/u&gt;

It is my personal conviction that the body of Christ today is more divided and splintered than ever before.

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 4.3-6 Endeavoring to keep the unity of The Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all&lt;/strong&gt;

In this letter to the Ephesian church, Paul presents one of the most significant statements on spiritual unity shared anywhere in the Bible. He contends that in the church of Jesus Christ there is only one body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all.

It has been said that, "&lt;em&gt;To have religious zeal, without becoming a religious partisan, is a great proof of true devotion to Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;."

All of these references using the word one reflects the high priestly prayer of Jesus in &lt;strong&gt;John 17.22,23 And the glory which thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&lt;/strong&gt;

To endeavour is a call to work for unity among believers with a passion and commitment that result in a 100% effort. We must remember that Jesus made unity among believers paramount in His prayer to the Father (John 17:20-23). It is to be one of our primary examples to a non-believing world of the power of Gods love within us.

This unity of The Spirit is not based upon human institutions but rather on that which transcends all distinctions. The Name of Jesus and the one and only gospel that bears His Name.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;11.23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 11,25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;proclaim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) the Lord's death till he come.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul repeats and then comments on the words with which The Lord Jesus spoke at The Last Supper, which was in reality a Passover Seder, or meal. (&lt;strong&gt;Mt 26. 2629; Mk 14. 2225; Lk 22.1520.)&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul tells us that he received of The Lord Himself the ordinance of The Lords Supper and its meaning. Since the dating of this letter was written before any of the gospels, this is the first written mention of the meaning and purpose of The Lords Supper in the New Testament.

&lt;strong&gt;Broken for you &lt;/strong&gt;is a reference to the physical cruelty of Jesus death. What is eaten is called bread, though at the same time it is said to be the body of the Lord, plainly showing that the apostle did not mean that the bread was changed into flesh.

To eat the bread and drink the cup &lt;strong&gt;in remembrance of Me &lt;/strong&gt;is far more than thinking back about something that happened to Jesus in a purely historical sense.

Remembrance in this sense means &lt;em&gt;to call to mind; weigh well and consider what Jesus was doing when He hung on that cross. &lt;/em&gt;The essential purpose of the Lords Table is to call to mind, weigh well and consider the meaning of the once and for all sacrifice of Jesus Christ, The Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world.

The &lt;strong&gt;new covenant&lt;/strong&gt;, sealed by the blood of Jesus, was prophesied in &lt;strong&gt;Jer. 31:3134 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord: But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&lt;/strong&gt;

It is the blood of Jesus Christ that seals and thus ratifies the new covenant&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Heb 9.11,12 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;once and for all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) into the holy place, having obtained (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a finished work in the past tense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) eternal redemption for us. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Rom 5.8,9 But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&lt;/strong&gt;

The New Covenant is a declaration that Jesus Christ is The Author and Finisher of our faith. The Old Testament shadows of the sacrificial, ritualistic and ceremonial system has been replaced by the once and for all perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which He accomplished by His death on the cross (&lt;strong&gt;Heb. 8:713&lt;/strong&gt;).

Priests under the Old Covenant repeatedly offered the blood of animals; but the New Covenant has been ratified once and for all by the death of Christ. Jesus Christ shouted on the cross the words that rocked the universe, &lt;strong&gt;It is finished! &lt;/strong&gt;

Isnt it interesting that the chief ordinance of Christianity is the commemoration and proclamation of the death of The Lord Jesus?

The Lord's Supper is an acted sermon; &lt;strong&gt;you do show The Lords death. &lt;/strong&gt;The Lords Supper not only reminds us to look back on Christ's life and death on the cross. It also reminds us to do so in have an eager and joyful, anticipation of His return.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Tim 4.8 &lt;/strong&gt;mentions those who &lt;strong&gt;love His appearing. Hebrews 9.28 unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.&lt;/strong&gt;

Are you among those who are eagerly waiting for His soon return? Is the Second Coming of Christ a doctrine that you believe, or a driving force of how you live and prioritize your life?

One out of every 30 verses in the Bible mentions the subject of Christ's return or the end of time.

Of the 216 chapters in the New Testament, there are well over 300 references to the return of Christ.

23 of the 27 New Testament books mention Christ's return.

In the Old Testament, such well-known and reliable men of God as Job, Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, as well as most of the minor prophets mention Christ's return in their writings.

Christ often spoke specifically about His own return to earth.

Throughout the centuries, Christ's disciples and followers have adamantly believed, written, and taught that Christ would someday return to earth. And every person that has this hope.

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 22.20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PARTAKING OF THE LORDS SUPPER UNWORTHILY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.27 Wherefore (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in light of what the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross means&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Gk anaxios means &lt;em&gt;in an unworthy, improper or careless way&lt;/em&gt;. It speaks of a self- centered and irreverent attitude. It means to come to the table indifferently, or with an unrepentant heart, or a spirit of bitterness, or any other ungodly attitude. This unrepentant attitude reveals a rebellious heart and an open disrespect and contempt for the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made to provide that forgiveness.

Some people do not believe that they should take the elements because they are struggling with some easily besetting sin.

May I suggest to you beloved that The Lords table is the very place for the person to come for help when they are struggling with sin, wrestling with temptation, or caught up in carnality.

Matthew Henry beautifully wrote: &lt;em&gt;fearful believers should not be discouraged from attending at this holy ordinance. The Holy Spirit never caused this scripture to be written to deter serious Christians from their duty, though the devil has often made this use of it.&lt;/em&gt; 

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 4.14-16&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/strong&gt;

Lord, I come to you this morning with a desperate need for your grace, mercy and forgiveness. I eat of the bread and I drink of the cup, knowing that I am a sinner and that only in You can I find the forgiveness and cleansing of my sin.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Lords Supper is to a time for self-examination, and therefor is to be taken both seriously and soberly. Self examination means that I hold up the mirror of Gods Word and allow it to reveal to me any sin that needs to be confessed and repented of.

Its like going through the security scanner at the airport before you board a plane. The scanner is meant to detect any object that is dangerous or harmful for the safety of the flight.

Self-examination is a time for us to ask God to search our hearts and see if there be any wicked way in us. This is a God ordained time for us to not only get our hearts right with Him, but with one another as well.

At the end of Pauls second letter to the Corinthians, he writes these very sobering words:&lt;strong&gt; Cor 13.5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?&lt;/strong&gt;

To be reprobate means to be disapproved; not genuine. It means that there is no evidence of the fruit of someone professing to be a branch that is abiding in The Vine, Jesus Christ.

The implication is sobering. There can be those who come to church week after month after year after decade but who are not saved. How do you know if youre in the faith?

Is Jesus Christ dwelling in you? If so, you are a new creature, &lt;strong&gt;old things are passed away, behold all things become new.&lt;/strong&gt; There is an ongoing life of repentance and being conformed by The Holy Spirit into the image of Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;punishment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;have died&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;

To not discern The Lords body means to treat with indifference the meaning and purpose for why Jesus died on the cross. This is very serious.

These illnesses and deaths in Corinth were the consequence of carelessly coming to The Lords table with an unrepentant attitude. If your response is that sounds serious, you have gotten the point.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. &lt;/strong&gt;

We are typically pretty good at pointing out the sins and faults of others, arent we? Communion is about admitting, owning and confessing our sins to God.

&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 51.1-4a Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.32 But when we are judged, we are chastened (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;disciplined&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.&lt;/strong&gt;

In other words, we may think that we have fooled God when we tried to sneak something through the security scanner, but He loves us too much to let us self-destruct, thus He chastens us.

Please note that when The Lord chastens us, it is to prevent our being condemned with the unbelieving world.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;strong&gt;11.33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;11.34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.&lt;/strong&gt;

When we partake of The Lords Supper, we are not only celebrating the union that we have with The Lord Jesus Christ. We are also to do so with recognition that we are also united to one another in Christ.

It is not hard to see that there was some correlation between their self-examination and their attitudes towards others in the body.

&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;u&gt;The Call for servers and worship team&lt;/u&gt;

Did God convict you this morning? For many of us that conviction has been for the millionth time. For some of you, that conviction may have come for the very first time today. Do you know why The Lord convicts us?

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 3.19,20 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus convicts us because He loves us. He rebukes us and chastens us in order to call us back into sweet, intimate fellowship with Him.

The new birth is not a matter of religion, but of relationship. Its not a question of theology, but of intimacy. The new birth is much more than knowing about Jesus intellectually. The new birth is knowing Jesus Christ personally as Lord, Savior, Shepherd and King.

&lt;strong&gt;John 17.3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 9,23,24Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

		<title>1 Corinthians 12:1-11</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>This chapter is not an exhaustive list of spiritual gifts (see Romans 12.3-8; Ephesians 4.7-12; 1 Peter 4.10,11 for more examples). There are many gifts; people have different gifts; some people have more than one gift, and one gift is not superior to another. The Holy Spirit distributes all spiritual gifts, and their purpose is to build up the body of Christs for the glory of God. These gifts are for Body Building and Gods glory.

In Corinth, these spiritual gifts that were given to build one another up had become symbols of spiritual power and competition that was causing confusion during church services and rifts and rivalries outside of the 4 walls of the church.Some people thought they were more spiritual than others because of their gifts. This was a terrible misuse of spiritual gifts because the very purpose of the gifts is always to build one another up and help the church function in unity and for the gory of God, not to divide it.

There are three guiding principles that characterize the operation of the gifts of The Holy Spirit:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The principle of &lt;strong&gt;self control.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike paganism, the power of the Holy Spirit does not drive people into wild compulsive acts. The fruit of The Spirit is self-control.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The principle that &lt;strong&gt;Christ is glorified&lt;/strong&gt;. All manifestations of the Spirit are given for the glory of Christ, not the exaltation of the instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The principle of &lt;strong&gt;unity under the Lordship of Jesus Christ&lt;/strong&gt;. The main work of the Holy Spirit is to bring His people together under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
12.1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant (mistaken; lacking understanding).

The English word&lt;em&gt; gifts&lt;/em&gt; here is in italics. Meaning that it was added to help understand the text. The Greek word for spiritual is pneumatikos. It should be read, now concerning the things of The Spirit.

So what we are looking at are the things that relate to The Spirit of God and how He endows and empowers the body of Christ to serve Him and exhort one another.Peter explains the ultimate purpose for using these various God given gifts and abilities this way:

1 Peter 4.10,11 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

&lt;em&gt;I would not have you ignorant&lt;/em&gt; - I find it intriguing that Paul voices this same desire concerning:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Old Testament typology in 1 Corinthians 10&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the Rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the tactics of Satan in 2 Corinthians 3&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the future of Israel in Romans 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The very areas about which Paul did not want the church to be ignorant about are the very about which believers in the past and to the present day have had the most questions and heated debates.

12.2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

12.3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

In the sacrificial scheme, for something to be anathema meant alienated from God without hope of being redeemed. Evidently, there was an utterance given in some meeting where someone called Jesus accursed. Accursed- Anathema; doomed to destruction.
Paul makes it clear that it is impossible for a person praying in the Spirit to say Jesus is accursed. He then declared that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

Let me ask you a few very pointed questions. Do you believe that Jesus Christ is THE Lord? Do you believe that He died for your sins on the cross? Do you believe that Jesus rose again from the dead? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is God manifest in the flesh?

Did you know that the ability to know and believe these things is not because you or I are incredibly smart? That kind of knowledge comes to sinners like myself only one waythrough the Holy Ghost Who dwells within us. Therefore, if you can truly say that Jesus is the Lord, you can be assured that the Holy Spirit is residing in you and working through you.

12.4 Now there are diversities (distinctions; varieties) of gifts, but the same Spirit.

The word &lt;em&gt;gifts&lt;/em&gt; here in the Greek is the word charisma, from where we get the term charismatic. The Greek word charisma is a form of the word charis, or gracethat which is undeserved and unearned.Not only these gifts, but also any and every gift that we have is from God, and they are undeserved and unearned. That is why God hates boasting and spiritual pride.

John the baptizer said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven (John 3.27).John knew he had nothing apart from God. Any abilities, gifts, or ministry he possessed came directly as a gift from his heavenly Father. So, too, if there is any area in which you excel, it is solely because God sovereignly and graciously gave you the necessary desires, abilities, and provisions.

12.5 And there are differences (distinctions) of administrations (service; offices; ministries), but the same Lord.

The word administrations here can also be translated services, offices or ministries. This can point to the different "ascension ministry gift offices" in the church, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers, as Paul also described in Ephesians 4 and at the end of this chapter.

12.6 And there are diversities of operations (working), but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

The Trinity is completely involved in the giving, using, and empowering of all spiritual gifts. All three Persons of The Godhead are at work in the appointing and operation of these spiritual gifts.

In verse 4, we see different gifts, but the same Spirit. The gifts are linked to the Spirit.
In verse 5, we see different ministries, but the same Lord Jesus. The ministries are linked to the Son
In verse 6, we see different energies, but the same God. The operations are linked to the Father

I want to point out to you that some of the gifts are ministries or offices or positions in the church, such as apostles, prophets and teachers in verse 28. Some gifts are spontaneous or supernatural outpourings that are given at a particular time and place for a particular purpose.

12.7 But the manifestation (expression) of the Spirit is given to every man to profit (benefit; build up) withal.

Every person in the body of Christ is given a manifestation of The Spirit. These gifts are not to be hidden under a bushel. Nor are they to be used to promote myself.The ministry of the Holy Spirit is not to promote any man, but to glorify and exalt The Name of Jesus. Jesus said that when the Holy Spirit would come, He will testify of Me (John 15:26), and He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you (John 16:14).

&lt;strong&gt;To profit withal&lt;/strong&gt; means to benefit or build up. In other words, any Spirit anointed usage of our gifts will result in mutual edification and stronger disciples for the glory of God.Each particular saint is gifted by God to make vital contributions to the collective life and growth of the whole body.

Let's look at some Body Building Gifts:

12.8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

&lt;strong&gt;The word of wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; doesnt come from ones ability to figure out a situation. It is supernaturally given to answer a question or solve a problem. A word of wisdom is a spiritual utterance at a given moment through the Spirit that supernaturally unveils the mind, purpose, and will of God as applied to a specific situation as shown in Stephen (Acts 7), and Paul (Acts 23).

&lt;strong&gt;Word of knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; is a supernatural revelation of information pertaining to a person or an event, given for a specific purpose, usually having to do with an immediate need. This was seen in the life of Paul in his shipwreck on the way to Rome in Acts 27:10, 23-26.
Though these gifts are supernatural, they are given to benefit us personally and practically.

12.9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;-

&lt;strong&gt;Faith&lt;/strong&gt;- Every Christian possesses the indwelling Spirit and has a measure of faith. If he didnt, he wouldnt be saved. This gift of faith speaks of those times when God gives to an individual a special measure of faith to do the will or work of God. The operation of this gift of faith is the ability to step out in response to the leading of the Spirit and do something you would never have done otherwise, as when Peter walked on water.

&lt;strong&gt;Gifts of healing&lt;/strong&gt;- It is always in the plural, and it refers to the various healings that God performs supernaturally by the Spirit. This refers to a special gift that God gives to individuals at a certain point in time to minister healing. The bible does not teach that anyone has a singular gift of healing whereby he or she can line people up and heal them all.

12.10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

Miracles are a manifestation of power beyond the ordinary course of natural law. It is a divine enablement to do something that could not be done naturally. Please do not think of what you see on Christian television. Many of Gods people are duped into thinking that if they could just see a miracle or two, their faith would soar. Not so. Ask the nation of Israel! Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17). For the believer, the way to grow in faith is not to see the miraculous, but to take in the Scriptures. Follow The Word, obey The Word and miracles will happen.

&lt;strong&gt;Prophecy&lt;/strong&gt; is a multi faceted gift.The prophet Joel had written the words of the Lord, Joel 2:28I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.This gift of prophecy most commonly refers to the forth telling of The Word of God as it is expounded in the assembling of the saints. 1 Cor 14.3 He that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.

But it can also refer to times when The Spirit of God will prophesy of future events as when in Acts 11.28 Agabus signified by the Spirit that there should be a dearth throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

It can refer to a spontaneous, Spirit- inspired message that is orally delivered either in a church service or outside of a church building for the edification and encouragement of the body of Christ.Since no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, it should be noted that since the canon of Scripture is complete, all such inspired writings like the book of Mormon are false and are to be rejected.

&lt;strong&gt;Discerning of spirits&lt;/strong&gt; is the ability to discern the spirit world, and especially to detect the true source of circumstances or motives of people. As when the next to blind prophet Ahijah discerned Jeroboams wife in 2 Kings 14.

&lt;strong&gt;Divers kinds of tongues&lt;/strong&gt; is the gift of speaking supernaturally in a language not known to the individual. The plural kinds allows different forms, possibly harmonizing the known spoken languages of Acts 2:46 and the unknown transrational utterances in Corinthians, designed particularly for praying and singing in the Spirit, mostly for private worship (14:1419)

&lt;strong&gt;Interpretation of tongues&lt;/strong&gt; is the gift of rendering the transrational (but not irrational) message of the Spirit meaningful to others when exercised. This interpretation of tongues is not what took place on the Day of Pentecost. They heard the apostles speak the Word of God in their native language. Nobody needed to interpret for them.

12.11 But all these (all these, not just some of these) worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing (appointing) to every man severally as he will.

Note that it is God Who distributes these gifts. We do not pick and choose which gifts we want. This should quench any potential jealousy, envy or tendency to boast or brag.How wonderful it is to know that the churchs mission is not limited to the abilities of mere human intelligence, wisdom or knowledge. The Holy Spirit has provided these specially designed, distributed, and energized gifts according to His sovereign will and timing.

		<ns3:encoded>As we explore these passages of Scripture this morning, Id like us to ponder them in light of Jesus prayer in John 17 that He and His body would be one. That prayer is not only the desire of the heart of Jesus for KF. It is the prayer and desire of the heart of Jesus for the all those who have been born into the body of Christ, by grace, through faith in Him.

With that prayer in mind, what do you think Satans number one objective is in regards to the body of Christ? To steal, kill, destroy and divide. Why? Because Satan knows for a fact what the vast majority of Christians only know in their heads. A house divided against itself cannot stand.

Know this beloved, The Lord Jesus has saved you and equipped you to be a blessing to the body of Christ. Know this too, Satan desires to sift you like wheat and use you as an instrument of division, discord and dissension. Secret, self promoting agendas. Resentment, the refusal to forgive from the heart. Pride.

&lt;strong&gt;12.12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

Beginning with verse 12, Paul introduces the most prominent image of the church in all of scripture: the Body of Christ.

In the consideration of this passage let us drop down to include two other verses:&lt;strong&gt; But now are they many members, yet but one body (v. 20) Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular (v. 27). &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul uses the brilliant and beautiful illustration of the human body to relate the working of the community of the body of Christ.

Every cell in a human body is linked by a common DNA code, yet each individual part of our body (&lt;strong&gt;members&lt;/strong&gt;) look different are treated differently, work differently, and accomplish different purposes.

Likewise, there is great diversity in the body of Jesus Christ, both in appearance and function, yet each member has a common root, The Lord Jesus Christ, and a common goal, the glory of God.

&lt;strong&gt;12.13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;

The baptism that is being talked about here is the Spirit baptizing all who repent of their sins and believe in the death, burial and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ into the body of Christ. It is by The Spirit of God that all believers are baptized into the body of Christ.

Being baptized into the body of Christ not only means that you belong to Jesus Christ, it also means that you belong to everyone else who belongs to Jesus Christ.

Paul is not writing of water baptism or baptismal regeneration as some claim. Water baptism is an outward sign that depicts the believers union with Christ in His death and resurrection. In &lt;strong&gt;Romans 6.3&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; Paul speaks of &lt;strong&gt;being baptized into Jesus Christ. Buried with Him by baptism into death.&lt;/strong&gt;

When we become a Christian, the Holy Spirit takes up residence in us, and we are born into Gods family. To &lt;strong&gt;drink into one Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; means that each of us has received the same Holy Spirit. &lt;strong&gt;John 7:37-39&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.&lt;/strong&gt;

The word one occurs five times in 12:12-13. Hence, the emphasis is on unity and oneness.

Unity among believers is not obtained by insisting that all believers look the same, teach the same, or worship the same. That is uniformity. The body of Christ is not a cult. Unity is obtained among believers because we have all been baptized by The Spirit into Jesus Christ. We collectively are both His bride and His body.

&lt;strong&gt;Jews or Greeks, Slaves or Free&lt;/strong&gt; - The huge social divisions that existed in Roman society no longer counted in the body of Christ; all partake of His Spirit. The same applies today. There is no social, economic, racial or educational caste system within the body of Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;12.14 For the body is not one member, but many.&lt;/strong&gt;

Isnt this true of your body? The same is true of the body of Christ. You are not the only member in the body of Christ here at KF. KF is not the only member of the larger body of Christ. There is no such thing as private or individualistic Christianity.

Just like we depend on every part of our human body to function well, we function well as a body when every part is working according to their God given gifting and ability.

Verses 15-17 focus on those particular parts of the body that feel insignificant and unimportant. In verses 15-17, Paul illustrates the importance of each member for the unity of the one body by drawing a comparison to the human body.

&lt;strong&gt;12.15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? &lt;/strong&gt;

Try to picture being an eye-bodyone massive six-foot eye! How gross it would be if the whole body was an eye. Or how about a six foot ear?

Your body needs your foot, your hand, your ear, your eye and your nose to function properly. Each particular member contributes to the health of the whole body.

The eye is not the enemy of the hand. Can you imagine a hand plunging a fork of food into the eye instead of into its mouth?

The parts of the human body have been designed by God to work together. The eyes and ears do not only serve themselves, but the whole body. The hands do not only feed and defend themselves, but the whole body. The heart does not only supply blood to itself, but serves the whole body.

A body with just an eye would not be able to hear. A body with just an ear would not be able to smell. A body without feet would not be able to walk, and we could go on and on.

Sometimes there is a part of our body that only lives to serve itself. It doesn't contribute anything to the rest of the body, and everything it gets it uses to feed and grow itself. We call this &lt;em&gt;cancer&lt;/em&gt;. Satans agenda for every single local church and every single child of God is to turn it into a body destroying cancer cell.

&lt;strong&gt;12.18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.&lt;/strong&gt;

Why is the foot a foot and the hand a hand? Because it pleased the Designer to make it so. Likewise, God has arranged the members of the body of Christ (each individual with his or her gifts) according to His will.

May we learn to recognize and appreciate the vastness of the body of Christ. May we learn to recognize and appreciate the sovereignty of God in how He sets the various members into the body of Christ.

Each person has a place in Christs body according to Gods perfect plans and purposes, and all members are very important for the spiritual well- being and proper functioning of the entire church body.

&lt;strong&gt;12.19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.20 But now are they many members, yet but one body. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul explains that we need to squash spiritual pride because we all need each other. While the eye and head may seem like more important parts of a body, they cannot function without the support of hands and feet.

If all the church had was the pastors, elders, and deacons, how impoverished would that church be? We must always recognize that any public ministry is built on a private ministry. My preaching is only as powerful as your praying.

Every church has people who are out in the forefront and are more visible. But what is really essential to the ongoing life of the church is the people behind the scenesthose who serve faithfully and quietly (and often are the ones who make the leaders look good).

&lt;strong&gt;12.22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. &lt;/strong&gt;

J.B. Phillips paraphrases verses 22-25 beautifully:

&lt;em&gt;Those parts of the body which have no obvious function are the more essential to health: and to those parts of the body which seem to us to be less deserving of notice we have to allow the highest honour of function. The parts which do not look beautiful have a deeper beauty in the work they do, while the parts which look beautiful may not be at all essential to life! But God has harmonised the whole body by giving importance of function to the parts which lack apparent importance, that the body should work together as a whole with all the members in sympathetic relationship with one another.&lt;/em&gt;

The idea here is that we should not disregard members of the body who are in seemingly less important positions.

The public visibility of spiritual gifts should not be the basis for honoring a person or considering one Christian as more important than another.

Once again, Paul reminds us that it is God Who places the various members into the body.

Paul makes the incredible statement that the purpose of such diversity is that there be no divisions (&lt;em&gt;schism&lt;/em&gt;) in the body. This appears to be counterintuitive &lt;em&gt;until &lt;/em&gt;Christians realize that &lt;em&gt;unity is not uniformity. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.&lt;/strong&gt;

If you have a headache, do your legs say, Thats tough. Were going hiking anyway? No. If one part of your body hurts, your whole body rests.

If you throw a touchdown pass and win the game, does your left arm get upset because your right arm threw the ball? No, your whole body celebrates.

A brother in The Lord accidentally stepped off a curb and hurt his foot. When he went to the doctor, he asked him how many bones were in the foot. The doctor told him that there were twenty- seven. The brother said, I think I hurt all twenty- seven of them! No, said the doctor, you hurt only one. The brother may have hurt only one of the 27 bones, but his whole foot was painful. When one member suffers, they all suffer

So, too, as believers, we both suffer and celebrate together because were all members of the same body.

&lt;strong&gt;12.27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12.28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul gives here a partial list of the ministry giftsspecific God- given abilities and service roles that provide spiritual leadership and ministry for Gods people in the church&lt;strong&gt; (Ro 12:6- 8 and Eph 4:11- 13). &lt;/strong&gt;The list here differs somewhat from that in vv. 810&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Paul notes three of the gifts of &lt;strong&gt;Eph 4:11, &lt;/strong&gt;then five of the spiritual gifts listed in vv. 810. The apostles and prophets were part of the foundation of the church&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;

These three gifts are listed as first, second and third, indicating their importance in the church. The rest of the list is introduced with after that, indicating the variety that follows

&lt;strong&gt;Apostles- &lt;/strong&gt;After the coming of the Holy Spirit, apostles were sent out with the special task of proclaiming the Gospel and establishing churches. Those chosen by Christ during his earthly ministry to be with him and to go out and preach (&lt;strong&gt;Mk 3:14&lt;/strong&gt;). They were also to be witnesses of the resurrection (&lt;strong&gt;Ac 1:2122&lt;/strong&gt;)

&lt;strong&gt;Prophets- &lt;/strong&gt;The primary responsibility of New Testament prophets was not predicting the future, but rather presenting Gods message to their contemporaries.

According to &lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2:20&lt;/strong&gt;, the church is built upon the ministry of the apostles and prophets.

&lt;strong&gt;Teachers-&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to clearly explain and effectively apply the truths of Gods Word so that others will learn. Teaching was most associated with the pastoral office.&lt;strong&gt; 1Ti 3:2&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Helps- &lt;/strong&gt;This refers to people who have the gift of aiding others in various ways. It was primarily the help that was given to the poor, needy, sick and distressed. In John Bunyan's book &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim's Progress&lt;/em&gt;, "Help" came to Christian when he was mired in the "Slough of Despond." That is often when the gift of helps is most useful.

&lt;strong&gt;Governments (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;administrations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;This literally means, leadership or managerial skill", and is the same word used for someone who steers a ship. A person with this gift can help the church safely navigate difficult times and crises. This suggests that the spiritual gift of administration is the ability to steer a church or Christian organization toward the fulfillment of its goals by managing its affairs and implementing necessary plans. A person may have the gift of leadership without the gift of administration.

&lt;strong&gt;12.29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;12,.30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? &lt;/strong&gt;

The answer to all these questions is obviously No because theres wonderful, needful diversity in the body.

If believers were all apostles, or all prophets, or all teachers, or all miracle workers etc., then the body would not function properly.

&lt;strong&gt;Do all speak with tongues? &lt;/strong&gt;Great damage has been done in the church by promoting tongues as necessary to really live as a Christian, or as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; evidence of the Holy Spirit's presence. This has caused many to seek the gift of tongues, or to "fake" the gift of tongues.

&lt;strong&gt;12.31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul encourages us to covet earnestly the gifts. But Paul will explain the &lt;strong&gt;more excellent way&lt;/strong&gt; in chapter 13, with a focus on love, not the gifts themselves. The gifts are merely ways we can express and receive love from God and love to one another.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>As Christians, we are free in Christ to engage in social practices and customs that are not sinful or specifically forbidden by biblical commands.Yet, there are numerous areas of life that are not specifically forbidden in Scripture where the overruling principle of love will prompt a mature saint to refrain from engaging in such things.And the reason why we will refrain from engaging in any of those things are:

(1) for the sake of not hindering the growth of our younger or weaker brothers and sisters in Christ,

(2) for the sake of our witness of Christ before those who have yet to come to faith in Christ.

There are two extremes that we need to be aware of in those areas not specifically forbidden in Scripture.

One extreme is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;license&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: the license camp says that if the Bible does not prohibit a particular practice or clearly label it as sin, then there is freedom under grace to participate in it. For this camp, Christian freedom is absolute and without restriction. Personal preference and feelings become the determining factor of whether or not I can engage in this freedom. This freedom that is totally self centered and independent of its impact on others inevitably grieves the Holy Spirit, hinders a weaker saints growth in Christ and in many cases sends a wrong message of what the gospel is all about.

The other extreme is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;legalism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: the legalism camp says that whatever issues are taboo for me, must be taboo for everyone else in the body of Christ. The legalists approach to Christian living turns everything into an elaborate set do and dont rules. Thus, their personal convictions on any given subject becomes the expectation and 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; commandment for the rest of the body of Christ.

It should be noted that both the license and legalistic believer are self centered and self-ruled and lack any sensitivity or regard for the opposite convictions of others.Obviously, the Bible does not teach either license or legalism as the pathway to Christian freedom. Christian freedom in Christ is always limited by Biblical principles and how it impacts others.In Scripture, the principle of Christian liberty is always tied in with Christian responsibility towards others.

Let me make 3 things perfectly clear:

For the sake of Christ and the furtherance of His gospel, the issue of Christian freedom within the body of Christ and as an ambassador of Jesus Christ in a lost world is never a matter of personal preference without regard for the adverse impact it may have on others.

No Christian can participate in anything that is clearly called sin in Scripture and call it liberty.

I have to say that I am baffled and deeply concerned over the pictures, postings and comments made by Christians on Facebook that violate the principles of love and Christian maturity spoken of in 1 Corinthians 8.

As we saw last week,Paul had perfect freedom to eat meat offered to idols. He knew that there was only one true God and that idols were nothing. Eating meat offered to them was neither right nor wrong.But not all believers felt that way. A person who had a weak conscience due to their past believed that the meat was defiled by the idol, and therefore it was off limits.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.6 He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. &lt;/strong&gt;

So who is right? How was Paul going to address these opposite views that existed in Corinth? Lets listen beloved, for the same principles apply to us today in 2015.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.1-4 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.&lt;/strong&gt;

Remember that the Corinthians prided themselves on knowledge. Paul told them that Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. He is going to tell them and us this morning that the Christian life isnt about how much you know, but about how much you love. The opposite of love is selfishness.

&lt;strong&gt;8.7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. &lt;/strong&gt;

The weak Christians in Corinth felt it was a sin to eat meat sacrificed to idols. Because of their upbringing, earlier habits, or former lifestyle, the weak still believed that they were in some way participating in idol worship by eating the meat.

Paul uses the term &lt;strong&gt;conscience&lt;/strong&gt; 8 times in the Corinthian letters. The conscience refers to that moral inner sense of what is appropriate or inappropriate (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 23:1&lt;/strong&gt;). It has been said that our conscience is God's doorkeeper that was placed within us to keep us out of the areas we don't belong in.Some of these precious saints in Corinth had consciences that could not grasp the nothingness of idols. Their weak conscience would not permit them to eat food offered to an idol.

Although eating meat offered to idols was not a threat to the true God, and although eating meat offered to idols wouldnt affect some saints personally, what the body of Christ needed to be aware of was the fact that their indulgence in their liberty of eating this meat was having a confusing and adverse affect on those weaker saints who did not have that conviction.

&lt;strong&gt;8.8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.&lt;/strong&gt;

Neither eating meat nor not eating meat will make us more acceptable to God. A believer would not be more holy or better if he or she ate meat. Nor would a believer be closer to God if he or she did not eat meat.Basically speaking, food does not bring us closer to God or keep us from God.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.17 The kingdom of God is not meat nor drink, but righteousness, peace and joy in The Holy Ghost. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 13.9 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt; a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.&lt;/strong&gt;

There were those legalists in Pauls day that were making what you ate or did not eat a matter of salvation. In &lt;strong&gt;Phil 3.9, &lt;/strong&gt;Paul said that their belly had become their god.

&lt;strong&gt;8.9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. &lt;/strong&gt;

The admonition to &lt;strong&gt;take heed (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;take care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;reminds us that The Lord Jesus Christs interest in the weaker brothers walk is greater than His interest in you exercising your personal freedom.

When knowledge is not filtered through the unselfish standard of the love of God and sensitivity towards others, the exercising of that liberty is unloving and &lt;strong&gt;a stumbling block&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;weak&lt;/strong&gt; Christians walk with God.

Let me explain what is meant by stumbling block. A stumbling block is not an act that offends a person; it is an act that leads a fellow believer into what is sin for him or her. A stumbling block is not just anything that causes someone to be offended. It is not a stumbling block for a man to have long hair and a ponytail, if the people who are offended by this are not thereby tempted to have a ponytail themselves, and in so doing violate their conscience. It cannot be a stumbling block when a woman is offended at a mans beard, unless she is tempted to grow a beard and in doing so would violate her conscience.

The acid test of the new birth in 1John is love.

&lt;strong&gt;1 John 2.9-11 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;8.10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Emboldened- &lt;/strong&gt;In verse 10, Paul employs a word that is translated &lt;em&gt;strengthened&lt;/em&gt; in the NASB; &lt;em&gt;encouraging&lt;/em&gt;, J. B. Phillips).

Paul seldom uses the word in this negative sense. It is most often positively used with the meaning &lt;em&gt;edified&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;built up&lt;/em&gt;. What Paul is saying here is that &lt;em&gt;eating idol-meat is reverse edification. It builds up or strengthens others, encouraging them or emboldening them to sin.&lt;/em&gt;

Paul has just said in verse 1 edifies (&lt;em&gt;the same root word&lt;/em&gt;). Eating idol meat so as to encourage a weaker brother to sin is not walking in love! It is, instead, putting a stumbling block in his path (verse 9).

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.14,15 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;8.11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? &lt;/strong&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; that Paul is referring to here in verse 10 goes back to &lt;strong&gt;8:1-4&lt;/strong&gt;.

Strong believers know that there is only one God (8:4).

Weak believers are influenced by their past.

Thus, strong believers are to act lovingly toward other believers, even weak ones, superstitious ones, legalistic ones, ascetic ones, or baby ones!

By partaking in an activity I may have the freedom to enjoy, I can potentially ruin my brother. Paul does not mean ultimate spiritual destruction, for he calls this man a &lt;strong&gt;brother, for whose sake Christ died&lt;/strong&gt;. The destruction for the weak brother is that he may be emboldened or tempted to revert to his old pagan ways.

More important than the knowledge that I am free to do this or that is the realization that my liberty could adversely affect my weaker brother.

The selflessness of Jesus &lt;strong&gt;Christ&lt;/strong&gt; is the example for every saint in the body of Christ to follow. If Jesus Christ loved &lt;strong&gt;this brother&lt;/strong&gt; with a weaker conscience so much that He was willing to give up His exalted rights and even His life (&lt;strong&gt;Phil. 2:6, 8&lt;/strong&gt;), surely, the more mature believer would gladly give up his right to eat such meat for the glory of God.

&lt;strong&gt;8.12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

Think this through Koinonia. Before you say, Ill do what I want, go where I want, eat what I want, post on Facebook what I want, you need to realize that if, flaunting my liberty is knowingly causing my weaker brother to stumble, I sin not only against him but against Christ. That is a very serious matter.

How much does Jesus identify with His bride?

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 9.4 Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 25.40 Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these, ye have done it unto Me. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Luke 17.1,2 It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So here is the conclusion; the practical application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;8.13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul would write in &lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul is willing to deny himself of any personal freedom, if he knew that his conduct was likely to be the occasion of leading others into sin or throw their walk with Christ into a tailspin.

Paul was motivated by the love of God for his fellow believers. He would rather set aside a liberty permanently rather than indulge himself if he knew that it would impede a fellow believers growth in Christ or embolden a weaker believer to be tempted to fall back into his or her sinful past.

The highest principle governing my choice in disputable matters is denial of self and love for a fellow believer who might disagree with me on that issue.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 14.19,20 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. For meat destroy not the work of God.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A legitimate question&lt;/h3&gt;
Must I limit my liberty for someone who considers himself or herself a spiritual policeman and is a legalist? No. Paul is talking about an action that might cause a weaker brother to &lt;em&gt;stumble&lt;/em&gt;. He is not talking about engaging in a legitimate liberty that simply makes a pharisaical Christian &lt;em&gt;frown&lt;/em&gt;. Much of what Jesus did caused the legalistic Pharisees to frown. If we governed our entire lives by the frowns we receive from legalistic Christians, wed be living in spiritual straightjackets.

God does not ask us to give up our liberty to please the unappeasable legalist. But if a weak brother is sincerely trying to grow, he or she deserves every sacrifice we might make. The actions of a mature saints must never be a hindrance to the spiritual progress of those who are weak.

In this passage there are 2 great principles that are eternally valid.

&lt;u&gt;Nothing ought to be judged solely from the point of view of knowledge; everything ought to be judged from the point of view of love.&lt;/u&gt; There is always a certain danger in knowledge. Head knowledge tends to make a man arrogant and feel superior and look down unsympathetically on the man who is not as far advanced as him. Knowledge of that kind is not true knowledge. The exercise of our Christian liberty should always be guided by selfless and considerate love for our fellow man, not by the thought of our own superior knowledge.

This leads to the greatest truth of all. &lt;u&gt;No man has any right to indulge in a pleasure or to demand a liberty that may be the downfall of someone else.&lt;/u&gt; An individual may have the strength of mind and will to keep that personal liberty in its proper place. That liberty may be safe enough for him and God in the privacy of his own home. But when it comes to exercising any Christian liberty in public, we cannot only be thinking about ourselves, but about the weaker or new convert to Christ. Know this beloved, any indulgence of Christian liberty which may be the ruin of someone elses walk or a hindrance to someone coming to the saving knowledge od Jesus Christ is not a pleasure but a sin.55

		<ns3:encoded>Although the subject of motives in serving The Lord is very important and will be the subject matter at the Judgment Seat of Christ.The immediate context of our study this morning in verses 10-15 is directed to leaders, and their pure or impure motivation behind the use of their spiritual gifts in ministering to the body of Christ at Corinth. This is the thrust of the warning found in verses 16 &amp;amp; 17.

Although the immediate context &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; leaders, this certainly does not limit the warning to just leaders alone. This context of the letter up to this point, (beginning in chapter 1) specifically addresses &lt;em&gt;all those who were guilty of promoting factions and divisions&lt;/em&gt; within the church.

Remember, Paul began this letter of correction by addressing the most harmful and grievous matter of all. The sowing of dissension, discord and division within the church.
&lt;h3&gt;The Foundation of the Christian life is the gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 3.10,11 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul was the builder that God used as His instrument to lay the foundation at Corinth. That foundation was The Lord Jesus Christ, His propitiatory sacrifice on the cross for our sin, death, burial and bodily resurrection from the dead on the third day.

&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 28.16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2.19-22 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul knew that it is only in Christ that a person can find &lt;em&gt;forgiveness for the sins of the past; strength and grace to confront the power of sin in the present; the precious promise and hope of being delivered from the presence of sin for all eternity. &lt;/em&gt;

There is only one foundation for the church. If it isn't founded on Jesus Christ, it isn't a church at all.

One of the things that is important to notice as we continue to navigate our way through this epistle is how Paul &lt;em&gt;never moves from the centrality of the Lord Jesus Christ in dealing with any problem in the church.&lt;/em&gt; Sexual immorality; brothers taking one another to court to settle disputes; the misuse and abuse of Christian liberty; the issues of singleness, marriage; the improper use of spiritual gifts; heretical views of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

As far as Paul was concerned, the Lord Jesus Christ, His gospel and His glory are the very solution to all any and all broken relationships, doctrinal errors or aberrant behavior in Corinth.

Did you catch in the passage how Paul did not have any doubt at all that his ability to minister the gospel of Jesus Christ was because of the grace of God.

In &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.10,11 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 4.10,11 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. &lt;/strong&gt;

The glory of God, not the exaltation of any minister is the goal of all ministerial gifting. This boasting over leaders was a huge problem in Corinth that was causing division amongst the brethren.
&lt;h3&gt;The subject of motives and materials used to build upon the foundation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 3.12-15 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every man's work shall be made manifest (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;apparent, evident&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;): for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;disclose what has been veiled or covered up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.&lt;/strong&gt;

Before we go any further in our study, let me pass along to you the &lt;u&gt;2 non-negotiable qualities necessary for those who bring forth Gods Word&lt;/u&gt;:

The leaders/believers &lt;u&gt;message &lt;/u&gt;must be &lt;u&gt;Christocentric&lt;/u&gt;.

The leaders/believers life and &lt;u&gt;motivation&lt;/u&gt; must be &lt;u&gt;Christ like&lt;/u&gt;.

Let me make it crystal clear here that verses 12-15 refers to the subject of motivation and rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ, &lt;em&gt;not salvation&lt;/em&gt;.

Salvation is not a reward for stellar service or sinless perfection on earth. Salvation is a gift &lt;em&gt;of &lt;/em&gt;God and &lt;em&gt;from &lt;/em&gt;God, by grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ &lt;em&gt;not of works lest any man should boast. &lt;/em&gt;

This whole section is all about a believers works and the motivation behind the works.

The life of faith and obedience is &lt;em&gt;a result of salvation, not a means to salvation. Rewards can be lost, yet salvation retained&lt;/em&gt;.

Verses 12-15 put in front of us some of the most misunderstood and wrongly interpreted passages in the entire Bible.

The Roman Catholics use verses 13-15 to prove their doctrine of purgatory. That is the teaching that if a person is not good enough to go to heaven or bad enough to go to hell, he or she is sentenced to purgatory where the fire or purging of sin will purify people in the next life and make them fit for heaven. Purgatory is not what Paul is talking about here at all. Purgatory is strictly a human invention, and denies the finished work of Jesus for the believer.

The modern, syncretic theology of the day uses these verses to prove that salvation is a combination of the grace of God &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; good works. Paul is not teaching that salvation is a combination of the Christs sacrifice and my qualifying good works. Christ + works = salvation &lt;em&gt;is not the gospel. &lt;/em&gt;

While this passage along with many others teach that there will be a judgment of believers works at the judgment seat of Christ, the most direct application is directed to workers and pastors of the local churches.

In context, this portion of his letter, Paul is addressing to those leaders in the church who were actually embracing the factious spirit that we read about in chapter one. I am of Paul, I am of Cephas, I am of Apollos, and I am of Christ.

This section describes two kinds of Christian workers:

&lt;em&gt;The wise builder (v. 14)&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 127.1 Except The Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. &lt;/strong&gt;

The wise builder uses lasting materials like gold, silver and precious stones. Gold, silver, precious stones speak of durable material like teaching sound doctrine. Communicating the whole counsel of God accurately, lovingly and faithfully. Instead of teaching the word of God through the divisive lens of isms or systems.

This wise builder seeks to honor Christ, aiming for quality that will glorify Christ, not quantity that will win the praise of men.

Wise builders use the Word, they pray and depend on the Spirit; as a result, their work is lasting. When the fire tries their work in glory, it will stand!
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The worldly builder (v. 15)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The second builder uses materials that cannot stand the test. Wood, hay, straw speaks of inferior materials implying shallow activity with no eternal value. They do not refer to activities that are evil.

Mixing the wisdom of men with the wisdom of God in the work of building the church is like using alternate layers of straw and marble in building. It is mixing the Word with worldly materials of philosophy, psychology or methodology.

Straw may be fine, it may have a place (in the barn), but it is an inadequate building material. In the same way that human wisdom may have a place in life, but not in the building of the church.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5:10&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that the wood, hay, and straw are worthless things that dont stand the test of judgment fire.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5.10 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.&lt;/strong&gt;

This is the Christian worker who may be drawing a crowd, but they certainly are not making disciples. The crowd drawing materials they use come from the worldwood, hay, and stubble.

These builders are more interested in statistics, than souls. Bigger is better. At the end of the day, it is all about growing their church or their denomination or making disciples after their favorite teacher or theologians image and likeness. When this ministry is tested in eternity, it will burn up.

&lt;strong&gt;Saved, yet so by fire- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The loss of some, much, or all&lt;/u&gt; of a believers lifes work has to do with their worldly motivation or methodology. It does not in anyway affect the foundation of saving faith in Jesus Christ. These are not leaders who are preaching another Jesus or another gospel.
&lt;h3&gt;Explanation of the usage of fire&lt;/h3&gt;
Like so many metaphors in the Bible (e.g. leaven, lion) fire can be a blessing or a curse depending on the context. The fire analogy is to be understood in a metallurgical sense. Fire reveals the true metal and burns off the dross.

The picture Paul uses of Gods judgment is of a fire sweeping through a building. It will consume all that is combustible and leave what has been built upon Jesus Christ as the foundation, with His honor and glory alone as its object.

Quality is what matters rather than quantity. At the Judgment Seat of Christ, will your work done for The Lord be proved to be gold, silver, costly stones or wood, hay or straw?
&lt;h3&gt;The warning given to those who defile the temple of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Corinthians 3.16,17 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&lt;/strong&gt;

The pronoun you is &lt;em&gt;plural&lt;/em&gt;, while temple is &lt;em&gt;singular&lt;/em&gt;; therefore, in this context temple must refer to the whole church at Corinth (cf. &lt;strong&gt;2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:2122&lt;/strong&gt;), which may have involved several house churches.

The temple here is the Church, the body of Christ, as distinguished from the temple in 6:19, which is the physical body of the individual Christian.

The defiler of the temple refers to the individual, be it a teacher or layperson that does not build the church up, but either tears it down or divides it. The Greek word that is translated defile is also translated destroy in verse 17. This word has the idea of corrupting, spoiling or withering.

Divisions and dissension among Gods people are counterproductive and actually grieve and quench the untiy of The Spirit of God Who indwells them as His temple.

Interestingly, in verse 19 &amp;amp; 20, Paul quotes &lt;strong&gt;Job 5.13 &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 94.11 &lt;/strong&gt;to point out that the root cause of the dissension and division within the church was a worldly spirit instead of The Holy Spirit.
&lt;h3&gt;Closing exhortations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exhortation to the body of Christ&lt;/strong&gt;

On the Day of Judgment, the fire of God is going to reveal the true motive behind the things that we do in The Name of Christ. You see beloved, it is not only &lt;em&gt;what &lt;/em&gt;we do that matters to Jesus, but &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;we do it.

Right deeds, wrong motives:

&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 13; Rev 2&lt;/strong&gt;; (loveless acts)

How tragic to consider that there are people who believe they are serving God, but are doing it in an unloving manner or with unworthy "materials", only to find in eternity that they have, in reality, done &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; for the Lord. What a waste!

Right Gospel, wrong motives:

&lt;strong&gt;Phil 1.12-15&lt;/strong&gt;

There were some who selfishly and insincerely preached Christ in order to make Pauls stay in prison more miserable. People got saved &lt;em&gt;in spite of the wrong motives, because God saves those who repent of their sin and turn to His Son. &lt;/em&gt;

Right deeds, wrong gospel

&lt;strong&gt;Matt 7&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;21-23&lt;/strong&gt; I never knew youworkers of iniquity.

Neither profession of faith, nor outward forms of godliness saves a person. Only those who repent of their sin and trust in Christ alone are His sheep and the people of His pasture.

&lt;strong&gt;Exhortation to those who have yet to repent of their sin and trust in Christ&lt;/strong&gt;

Salvation is a living, viable relationship with The Lord Jesus Christ. It is being born of The Spirit.

True salvation is the beginning of a life of ever growing intimacy with Jesus Christ. True salvation is an ongoing life of confession and repentance of sin, bearing fruit for the glory of God.

Genuine salvation is a once and for all completed action. An ongoing process (sanctification). A final destination (glorification with Christ forever).

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Jer 24.7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;In the midst of the many prophecies of judgment given by the prophet Jeremiah, we read in chapter 24 a prophecy spoken to those of Judah who were in Babylonian captivity. They were figuratively identified as good figs. Not only were they told that God would return them to their homeland. They were given a more glorious promise found here in our blog this morning. God says that He will give them a heart to know Him. They would be His people. They would return to Him with all of their heart.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;The promise given to these good figs is a beautiful picture of what God does to those who have trusted in Jesus Christ as full satisfaction of their sin debt. Later on in this book, this same promise that is recorded in Hebrews reads "but this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more." &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Hallelujah for the new heart and new life that we have in Christ!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Beloved, in Christ Jesus, not only are all of your sins forgiven you, but God has given you a heart to know Him. But according to the parable of the sower, that heart that God has given to know Him can also be choked with cares of this life and other pleasures and pursuits. So, like a "good fig", draw near to your God this morning with all of your heart. And, as your day unfolds, keep your eyes on Him and lay the stress, cares and allurements of the world at His feet.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Only the blood of Jesus</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Mark 14.24,25 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.And He said to them, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;The book of Leviticus tells us "for the life of the flesh [is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh an atonement for the soul." When Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the garden of Eden, they fell out of fellowship with Him. That fall resulted in a separation from God which is known as spiritual death. So how does fallen man get back into fellowship with God? Religion would say that we have to perform certain rituals or amass a certain amount of good works to erase our sin debt.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;When the early church was confronted by this, because they combined the rite of circumcision withfaith in Christ for salvation, they wrote, "But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they." Grace alone, through faith alone in Christ alone. Only the blood of Jesus can atone for our sin.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not only [so], but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement." Praise God for the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, The Lamb of God on the cross for our sin debt. Just as I am without one plea, but that Thy blood was shed for me.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;I pass along this fundamental truth this morning, beloved, because the devil is constantly seeking to get us on a works-based, religious treadmill that is exhausting and of no effect. We are forgiven, saved and have fellowship with The Father by His grace,through faith in the blood of Jesus. Ephesians 1:7 "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace." Come freely, come boldly, come humbly before your God this morning. Jesus has made the way, for He IS The Way.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;1 Kings 18.1,2 Now it happened after many days that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth." So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;For Elijah to go and see King Ahab at this point in time was an act of faith and courage. Because of the sin of forsaking God, and the worship of Baal, the nation was experiencing the consequence of judgments the form of a severe famine. To say the least, Elijah, who the prophet of Jehovah, was not a popular person in the "Ahab administration." What emboldened Elijah to go and give this prophetic message to Ahab? Elijah's faith in the promise of a God to send rain.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Beloved, when we embrace the promises of God in our heart, it emboldens us to walk in courage and faith. Your "foe" today may not be a wicked King, but it may be a relationship gone sour. A loss of employment that has left you bewildered. A sudden, unexpected loss of a loved one or your health. My prayer is that The Holy Spirit will reveal to you a promise or principle of God that will restore your faith and courage. Unbelief and doubt are debilitating. They crush your hope and zap your soul of energy and power. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;But, oh what faith in a promise of God will do! It will cause you to build an ark in a desert place like Noah. It will cause you to leave your homeland and step out in faith like Abraham. It will cause you to call down fire from heaven like Elijah. Dear ones, faith in the promises of God is not mind over matter. It is the belief that Jehovah rules and reigns in all things. It's the belief that all the promises of God are yes and Amen in Christ Jesus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;   One promise is that His mercies or covenant faithfulness are new this morning. To that we reply,great is Thy faithfulness oh God. May the promises and presence of Jesus embolden you today to walk with confidence in Him.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>I have only begun blogging the past few months myself, so I consider myself a novice as well. I try to write blogs that stem from my personal reading of Scriptures. When some thought or passage "jumps off the pages", I write and trust The Lord will use it to bless, challenge or encourage others. Above all, my desire is to point readers to Christ and seek to glorify Him in all that they do. Thank you for reading the blog, and I truly covet your prayers. Pastor Ray</ns0:comment_content>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Isa 50.10 Who among you fears theLORD, listening to the voice ofHisServant? Who among you walks indarkness, and has nolight? Let him trust inthename ofYahweh; let him lean on hisGod.(HCSB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;The Christian life is not only a wonderful adventure, it is also a mystery. Both writer and reader alike have experienced things in our Christian lives that we cannot reconcile with the love, goodness or faithfulness of God. Or as one writer said: Our ears are distracted with the noises of the world, harassed by the atheistic whisperings of Satan. Cherished plans have been thwarted, friends on whom we relied have failed us, a professed brother or sister in Christ has betrayed us. We are staggered.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Maybe that is you this morning, beloved. Your heart, mind and emotions are spinning out of control. Like Isaiah says, you fear The Lord. You listen to the voice of His Servant Jesus. And yet, you find yourself in a place of darkness with no light or apparent way out. Of course you pray. But maybe you are so spiritually "tapped out" that you find it even difficult to pray. Here is what The Holy Spirit inspired Isaiah to write to someone like you. Trust in The Name of Yahweh. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;To trust in The Name of God means to trust in the revelation of Who He is in Scripture. Yes, life may not be fair for you today. But Scripture declares that our God is good. He is merciful and full of compassion. He is faithful and true. Let those truths sink deep down into your heart this morning. Do not let your circumstances or your emotions form your "statement of faith" regarding the character of God. Many times God ties His love for us with the message of the cross. The apostle John writes, "Gods love was revealed among us in this way: God sent His One and Only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins." On His cross, Jesus demonstrated the ultimate expression of love for us. That love is proof of His faithfulness as well. Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Look to The Lord today and once again embrace His love and faithfulness. Trust Him for every second of grace that you need. Trust Him for every second of strength that you need. Where else or to who else will you turn to? Cast all of your care and despair upon Him, for He cares for you.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Psa 57.1,2 [[To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.]] Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until [these] calamities be overpast. I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth [all things] for me. What is King David, the man after God's own heart. The giant slayer doing in a cave? He is being pursued by Saul, who wrongly perceives him to be his enemy. Nothing could be further from the truth. David had the opportunity to kill Saul, but did not. Nevertheless, David is running for his life and is in a cave hiding from Saul.&lt;/span&gt;

It is in that cave that David pours out his heart unto His God for mercy. Mercy, of course, is not getting what we deserve. Neither writer or reader want God to give us what we deserve. Thus, we need His mercy. Scripture tells us that God's mercy has been poured out upon us through His Son, Jesus Christ.

Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour. How vital it is for us to "draw strength" from the vast supplies of God's mercies when we are in our caves in life. We also see that David fled to God on the wings of prayer and trust. He determined to commit himself to the shadow of The Almighty for the duration of the trial. Human resources are of little value in times of duress and pressure like David was in. Thus, he tapped into the mercy and protective shadow of God through prayer. But one more thing is needed to be seen here. David knew that God was in control. Yes, he was in real trouble and was obviously overwhelmed and anxious. But he knew that the invisible hand of God was guiding his life.

For all of my fellow cave dwellers, listen to verse 2 again. I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth [all things] for me. God is working in that cave beloved. He is working outside of that cave as well. Take heart, dear ones.

Psalms 138:8 The LORD will perfect [that which] concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endures for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. Every cave in life has it's season. The good pleasure of God is at work even in our caves. Cling to Jesus as long as you need to. He is faithful and good.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Our Fellowship in the Trinity</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Eph 2.18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

The Christian faith is both a profound mystery and profoundly simple at the same time. The doctrine of the Trinity is taught from the first verse in Genesis throughout the entire canon of Scripture. And yet, to grasp fully the "3 in One" revelation of Father, Son and Spirit by mere intelligence is impossible. However, there are passages regarding the operation of the Trinity that minister volumes to our souls. Such is our verse this morning. Read it again slowly and prayerfully.

Through The Lord Jesus Christ, you and I have direct access to The Father. How foolish is the religious tradition of praying to saints or to Mary! Yes, Mary is the most blessed woman in all of God's creation. She was the instrument chosen by God to bear the Christ Child. But we do not pray to her. She herself said that her spirit rejoiced in God her Savior. Neither do we pray to saints who have gone on to glory. That is the pagan doctrine of talking to the dead or necromancy.

No beloved, the clear and glorious teaching of Scripture is that every born again child of God has 24 hour a day "full access" to God Almighty. And when any one of His children come before Him, it is as if they are the only ones there. Hear again this glorious truth regarding our fellowship in the Trinity and with the Trinity. It is through Jesus that you and I have access to The Father by The Holy Spirit. We have the opportunity to live in communion with The Living God and Creator of the entire universe. Incredible! What amazes me even more is the fact that we can come before our holy God with boldness. Because it is in Jesus Christ that we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. Boldness. Confidence. By the faith of Jesus. It is even His faith that grants us this blessed access to The Father.

So as your day unfolds, hide our meditation verse in your heart. Remember beloved, we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The 4-Fold Vision: To Know Christ</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/the-4-fold-vision-to-know-christ/</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Though never articulated in sermon form, the 4-fold vision that has driven every single thing that Koinonia Fellowshipchurch is about and has done by the grace of God since The Lord planted it in December 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 1984 is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/105548589"&gt; &lt;img class="alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To know Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To grow in Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To proclaim Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;To bring God glory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Our desire is that through the teaching of Gods Word book-by-book, chapter-by-chapter, verse-by-verse, our doctrine and the practice of our faith would be rooted in Scripture, God-glorifying, Christ-exalting and Spirit-filled.

Our prayer is that Koinonia will be a God-centered, God-satisfied and God-saturated congregation that is driven with the passion to know Christ, grow in Christ, proclaim Christ and bring God glory in our church family. Our personal lives. Our marriages. Our children. Our vocations. Our relationships with one another.
&lt;h2 class="p3"&gt;Point number 1; To Know Christ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 17.3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;There are only 2 groups of people on Planet Earth: those who know Christ, and those who dont. Those who know God are in Christ, and those who do not know God are in Adam. Those to whom Jesus promised, I will never leave you nor forsake you; and those to whom Jesus said, I never knew you.John 17.3 clearly teaches us that to know Christ and possess eternal life is much more than saying that I believe in God. According to &lt;b&gt;Psalm 14.1; 53.1, &lt;/b&gt;when a person says that they believe in God, that only proves that he or she is not a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
John 17.3 clearly teaches us that to know Christ and possess eternal life is much more than possessing bible information about God. The devil knows bible information about God, and he does not have eternal life.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;You can know facts about Jesus Christ from the bible without knowing Him, just like you can know facts about President Lincoln and not know him.Knowing Christ and having eternal life does not mean that Christians will live longer than non-Christians. Every soul on this planet will live forever in one of two places, heaven or hell.
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;The fallen world is full of people whom the god of this world blinds and who have made the goal or supreme purpose in life the pursuit of wisdom, might and wealth. The book of Ecclesiastes says that such a life can be summed up in one word. Vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;To that pursuit of the things of this world, the prophet Jeremiah writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremiah 9.23,24 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
God says that the only life on earth that has anything to glory in is the life that has set its singular course of knowing Christ more intimately. A life where Jesus Christ has the preeminence over anyone or anything els,e including ones own life. Our prayer is that The Lord would give unto each and every person who calls Koinonia their church home a deeper and insatiable hunger, desire and thirst for The Lord as is described in &lt;b&gt;Psalm 42&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Psalm 73&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 42.1,2 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 73.25,26 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;This fallen world system is full or people who believe that they can have a relationship with God by observing rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 3.3-11&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord:for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Neither religion nor ritual can give you eternal life or bring you into a real relationship with God. No one comes unto The Father but by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, to the gory of God alone.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;This fallen world system is full of people who believe that they earn a right standing with God by doing good works, by which He then accepts them. Listen once again to the Word of The Living God:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 2.8-10 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom 4.4-8 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All of our good works apart from the atoning blood sacrifice of The Lord Jesus Christ are filthy rags of self-righteousness that are unacceptable in the sight of God.
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;So what does it mean to know Christ? How to I get to know God and live for Him? First of all, you begin a relationship with God when you realize that you have sinned against the holy God and when you flee for refuge to the provision God has made for your sin, the cross of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;No one seeks for God unless God first draws him or her to Him (&lt;b&gt;John 6:44; Rom. 3:11&lt;/b&gt;). And the vehicle that God uses to draw sinners is the Word of God. We come to know God by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Listen to what Jesus said to the religious man Nicodemus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3.14-18 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt; He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is by believing in the atoning death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ that we have eternal life.
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Listen to what Jesus said to the immoral woman at the well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 4:10,14 If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Eternal life is a gift that cannot be earned, but given to anyone and everyone who calls upon His Name to be saved.
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;To the Philippian jailer who asked Paul and Silas the question, &lt;b&gt;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&lt;/b&gt; Their reply was, &lt;b&gt;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.&lt;/b&gt;"Believe" means to trust in Him completely, cling to Him, rely on Him, and commit yourself totally to Him and His will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 12.1,2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Knowing God is not a one-shot deal; say the sinners prayer, sign the card and that is it. Knowing Christ is an ongoing pursuit of a relationship with Him, much like a couple begins to get to know one another better after their wedding ceremony. Knowing Christ is not a religious fad that lasts for a few years. This knowledge of God is something that will continue throughout all eternity!&lt;/p&gt;
HINT: we will never comprehend the fullness of knowing God even in eternity, for we will never get to the place where we will be able to say I know all about Him now.
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Knowing Christ is much more than making a decision to accept Him as Lord. The gospel is not accept and receive, but repent and believe. Knowing Christ is a life of revelation and repentance that begets a holy desire deep within your soul that craves for more of Him. Listen to Pauls prayer for the church at Ephesus: They are already saved and sealed with the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 1.15-17 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Knowing Christ is much more than dutifully reading Our Daily Bread, checking off the box, and then getting on with our lives. Listen to the verbs found in these Scriptures that describe the reading of Gods Word that results in knowing The Lord better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proverbs 2.1-5 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Knowing Christ is an ever-growing relationship that is rooted in the grace of God. The Apostle Peters last words are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Peter 3.18 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;I cannot express what it means to know and desire God better than King David, the man after Gods own heart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 63.1-8&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="p3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. Because thou hast been my help,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My soul thirsts for You. My flesh longs for You.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Seeking after God means that keeping your passion for God is the priority of your life. Knowing Christ is not just a matter of the head that may or may not change what you think. It is a matter of the heart, that changes how you think and how you live.

&lt;b&gt;My soul follows hard after Thee. &lt;/b&gt;We all make time to do what we really want to do. Let me give you an example: A young man in college who is working and carrying a full load of classes. His schedule seems packed. Then he meets the woman of his dreams. Suddenly he finds time to spend with her! Its not a duty; its a delight! He will cut corners elsewhere if he has to, but he will not miss his time with this beautiful creature. If you love God, youll make time to spend with Him because you delight to do so. This includes time in His Word, renewing your mind so that you can please Him. It includes time in prayer, bringing your needs and others needs before Him. It includes time in praise and worship, expressing your love for Him.

&lt;b&gt;Thy lovingkindness is better than life.&lt;/b&gt;Finally, The Lord Jesus Christ is not a part of your life; He is life itself. Jesus Christ isnt just a spoke in the wheel; Hes the hub. Jesus Christ isnt just a slice of life, who rounds out your other pursuits. The Lord Jesus Christ permeates every area of your life. Hes at the center of every decision you make. Hes the Lord of every relationship you have. You manage your money by considering what His Word says about it. There is no area of your life, be it your business, your family, youreducation, or whatever, where God is not an integral part. There is no division between sacred and secular; all of life is related to God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 1.20,21 Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Regarding eternal life, the late pastor Chuck Smith writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
&lt;ul class="ul1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;Eternal life is a quality of life. It is life in fellowship, communion, and oneness with God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;It is a life of righteousness, peace and joy. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace and joy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;It is life in the Spirit. It is as Christ described, it is the more abundant life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;It is the life that is described by David, when he declared, "My cup runneth over."&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;It is a life of joy unspeakable, and full of glory.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="li3"&gt;It is the joy of knowing my sins are forgiven, that my guilt is gone, pardoned, I am declared justified, by the judge of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you are readingthis and you do not know Jesus Christ as Lord, the bible has been declaring for the past 2,000 years:&lt;b&gt;Behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of salvation. &lt;/b&gt;I pray that God would use the sword of His Word to prick your heart with the truth of Who Jesus Christ is, and that you would respond by repenting of your sin, believe the gospel of Jesus Christ and receive Him as Lord.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>On the Day of Pentecost, (&lt;strong&gt;Acts 2:4, 6, 8&lt;/strong&gt;) speaking in tongues (&lt;em&gt;glossa&lt;/em&gt;) refers to individuals who spoke in dialects or languages other than their native tongue or language. That would be like me starting to speak in French or Arabic right now.

The people who heard them speak in tongues did not need the gift of interpretation to understand what they were saying, because they were speaking in their native tongue.If I were to speak in French or Arabic and an unsaved Frenchman or Arab person were here, they could tell you what I was saying.So the miracle on the Day of Pentecost was the God given ability to speak in another human language that they never spoke before.

When the word "tongue" is used in &lt;strong&gt;1 Cor. 14:2, 4, 13, 19, 26, 27&lt;/strong&gt;), it refers to the supernatural gift of The Spirit that enabled a person to speak in a language unknown to man.One who has this gift may pray, speak or sing in the spirit, but their mind may not understand what they are saying or praying.This tongue requires the supernatural gift of interpretation to understand what is being said..

The whole dissertation of the Apostle Paul on the subject of speaking in tongues is that no one should be speaking in tongues unless the hearers can understand what is being said.

&lt;strong&gt;14.26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Come together &lt;/strong&gt;speaks of their gathering together on The Lords Day (&lt;em&gt;usually the first day of the week or Sunday-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor 16.1,2&lt;/strong&gt;) for worship, the study of Gods Word and fellowship.

Paul refutes the notion of coming to church as passive spectator. When we come together, we should be looking for ways to bless one another and build one another up in the faith.

Remember that at this point in time, the churches met in peoples houses. As they would meet in these house churches, there would be a freedom, and a responsibility to not only receive from the pastor/teacher, but to share their gifts and insights with one another.

As a church grows numerically, this "everybody shares something with everyone else" on a Sunday morning or any other service becomes more difficult.

Among ten people, ten can share something with all the other ten. But among thirty, or sixty, or a hundred people, there isn't time to allow everyone to share something with everyone else.

Let me say that I believe that it is a big mistake for anyone to think, "If I'm not up on the platform teaching or leading worship, then I can't minister to someone else today."

I would encourage every one of you to be on the look out for opportunities to pray with people, encourage people, help people, meet people, and love people every time you come to church. Then take that contact to the next level of meeting with them and others in your home.

&lt;strong&gt;Let all things be done unto edification. &lt;/strong&gt;The purpose of us coming together as a church is not to be entertained or be spectators, but to build one an other up. The goal of building one another up is for the glory of God. As Paul said in &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Eph/4/12/s_1101012"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 4:12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the goal is &lt;strong&gt;the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Let all things be done unto edification &lt;/strong&gt;looks &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn't mean, "let everything be done for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; edification." It means, "let everyone come to church with a heart to build up someone else up in their walk with Jesus."

If you only come to church to get, and not give, receive and not share, you will not walk away as blessed as God intended you to be.
&lt;h3&gt;Guidelines for speaking in tongues (27,28)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14.27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;glossa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14.28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.&lt;/strong&gt;

The Biblical guidelines for speaking in tongues during a church service are:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In any one meeting, there must not be more than two or three who speak, pray or praise in tongues. And this can only be done when there is the gift of interpretation, so that others can understand and benefit from the message.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul here makes it plain that the gift of tongues is under the control of the person with the gift. They are not "compelled" by the Holy Spirit to speak out in tongues. If there is &lt;strong&gt;no interpreter&lt;/strong&gt; present, they should &lt;strong&gt;keep silent in church, &lt;/strong&gt;and speak quietly to God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that in verse 2 that when a person speaks in a tongue, they are talking to God. That means that if someone speaks out in a tongue, an individual gives an interpretation that sounds something like "Oh My children" or "The Lord would say to you" they do not have the gift of interpretation, because if they did, the interpretation would be man talking to God, not God to man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In verse 28, &lt;/strong&gt;the issue isn't whether a person can speak in tongues during a church meeting. The issue is if there is an individual with the gift of interpretation. If not, they should remain silent but are free to speak in tongues &lt;strong&gt;to himself and to God&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;h3&gt;Guideline for exercising the gift of prophecy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;14.29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. &lt;/strong&gt;

Having given instructions for the proper exercise of the gift of tongues, Paul moves on to other directives that also affect the order of public worship.Since he had emphasized the importance of prophecy, he points out that even this gift should be exercised in an orderly fashion.

&lt;strong&gt;Let two or three prophets speak&lt;/strong&gt;, while "the others" who have the gift of prophecy should evaluate the message to ascertain that it is not false.Paul wrote to the Thessalonians&lt;strong&gt; 1 Thess; 5.19-21 Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2Co/13/1/s_1091001"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 13:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; states a principle repeated at lease six times in the Bible:&lt;strong&gt;By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.&lt;/strong&gt;The fact that Paul instructed people with the gift of prophecy to speak in turn and then await evaluation by others in attendance indicates that the kind of prophecy in view here is not predictive or a foretelling of future events.

Remember, some were saying "in the spirit" that Jesus was accursed!

As John said in &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1Jo/4/1/s_1163001"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 John 4:1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14.30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. &lt;/strong&gt;

Notice also that prophecy was not considered an uncontrollable urge of the Spirit; the speaker could control the impulse because only one prophet could speak at a time.

&lt;strong&gt;14.31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14.32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Subject- &lt;/strong&gt;The word suggests subordination, obedience, submission, subservience, and subjection.

&lt;strong&gt;14.33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.&lt;/strong&gt;

Sometimes people will justify odd behavior by saying the Spirit overwhelmed them. But here Paul says even while ministering in the Spirit, a man is never out of control.

The fruit of The Spirit is self control. The Holy Spirit is not the cause of chaos and confusion, the human spirit is.

Note that the opposite of confusion is peace. There will be peace, not jitters or confusion when The Spirit of God is moving.

&lt;strong&gt;14.34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14.35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.&lt;/strong&gt;

Okay, the service is over! Does this mean that women are forbidden to speak or participate in church services today?

It is clear from &lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 11:5&lt;/strong&gt; that women prayed and prophesied in public worship.

It is also clear in chapters 1214 that women are given spiritual gifts and that they are encouraged to exercise them in the body of Christ.

According to Paul's letter to Timothy, a woman is not to teach doctrine in the general assembly of saints, such as today. She can pray. She can sing worship. She can give her testimony or read Scripture. But she cannot teach doctrine to men.

These verses must be understood in light of the social order and cultural issues of the day. Keep in mind that men and women were sometimes separated in worship.

The Greek word for speak in verse 34 means, "to talk, question, argue, profess, or chatter." It would appear that during a church service, women were asking their husband across the aisle questions. Paul was simply forbidding the women to interrupt the service by asking questions that could be dealt with at home.

&lt;strong&gt;14.36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? &lt;/strong&gt;

Paul exposes their spiritual pride. Some of the saints in Corinth believed that they were so spiritual that they did not need to be held accountable or corrected for the abuse or misuse in the operation of of spiritual gifts.

&lt;strong&gt;14.37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. &lt;/strong&gt;

These things that Paul writes here are the commandments of God.

&lt;strong&gt;14.38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;14.39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. &lt;/strong&gt;

The conclusion was that the Corinthians should give special attention to the gifts which were most beneficial to the church as a whole.

&lt;strong&gt;Do not forbid to speak with tongues&lt;/strong&gt;: Though Paul will carefully regulate, and even seem to caution the public use of tongues in the church, he will not &lt;strong&gt;forbid&lt;/strong&gt; it.

The gift of tongues is not to be despised. Paul himself spoke and prayed in tongues, and he personally knew that it has a valuable place in personal devotional time. But without an interpreter, it was better to keep quiet and speak to God privately.

&lt;strong&gt;14.40 Let all things be done decently and in order.&lt;/strong&gt;

Two extremes need to be avoided when it comes to the operation of the gifts of The Spirit: excessive reserve or excessive liberty.

Adam Clarke wrote: &lt;em&gt;How often is a work of God marred and discredited by the folly of men! For nature will always, and Satan too, mingle themselves as far as they can in the genuine work of the Spirit, in order to discredit and destroy it."&lt;/em&gt;

Decent and in order means following the instructions that are given here in Scripture. It doesn't describe a straight jacket.

These verses are a concise summary of chapter 14. The gifts of the Spirit are never to be made the focus of congregational life.Worship and the Word are the focus, and the gifts flow under God's direction around the focus of worship and the Word.

And when The Spirit of God is moving, Christ will be exalted, The Father will be magnified, and the people of God will be comforted, corrected, challenged, edified and encouraged in their walk with Jesus.

Two questions that I am asked about KF. Are you Reformed? Do you believe in the gifts of The Spirit for today? My answer. We are semi-Reformed and charismatic with a seal belt on.

My question for you today is this. Have you been born again? Do you know that your sins are forgiven and that have been saved from the wrath to come?

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 10.1-13 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&lt;/strong&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>In the opening four verses of this chapter, the Apostle Paul reminds us that the doctrine of Christ's resurrection from the dead is a vital part of the gospel.With that in mind, in verses 5-8 he then proceeds to offer proof that Jesus did indeed rise from the dead.In verses 12-19, the Holy Spirit develops for us and vigorously defends one of the great fundamental truths of Christian testimony; the bodily resurrection from the dead.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 6.1,2 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;elementary teachings about Christ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), let us go on unto perfection (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;maturity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of &lt;em&gt;resurrection of the dead&lt;/em&gt;, and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit.&lt;/strong&gt;

Apparently, there were some members of the church in Corinth who doubted or were confused about the biblical doctrine of the bodily resurrection from the dead. They no doubt were influenced by the pagan philosophies that were prevalent in Greco-Roman philosophies. That teaching went something like this. After death, the spirit lived on in another world, but as far as the body was concerned, it was laid away in the tomb, that was the end of it.

When Paul preached in Athens, their response to his message was:

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 17.18 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.&lt;/strong&gt;

In addition to this pagan philosophy, you recall that a very powerful religious sect called the Sadducees that did not believe in the resurrection of the body &lt;strong&gt;Acts 23.8&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.&lt;/strong&gt;

To counter these heretical views regarding the bodily resurrection, Paul goes on the offensive. In an effort to awaken the Corinthian believers to the importance of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, Paul paints a dismal picture of what life would be like if there had been no resurrection.

In verses 12-19, Paul says there are six things that would be in shambles if Christ did not rise from the dead.

If there was no resurrection from the dead, then we have:

12-13 &lt;strong&gt;No Living Savior&lt;/strong&gt;

14 &lt;strong&gt;No Living Faith&lt;/strong&gt;

17 &lt;strong&gt;No Forgiveness of sin&lt;/strong&gt;

18-19 &lt;strong&gt;No Hope&lt;/strong&gt;

But then in verse 20, Paul drops the death defying, heresy destroying nuclear bomb of the gospel: &lt;strong&gt;But now is Christ risen from the dead.&lt;/strong&gt;

So let's look at those six things that &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; the tragic reality if Jesus did not rise from the dead. And then lets see how the resurrection of Jesus Christ reverses and destroys all of those false conclusions.

- Verse 14: "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, our preaching is not in vain&lt;/em&gt;.

- Verse 14: " . . . and your faith is in vain." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, our faith is not in vain.&lt;/em&gt;

- Verse 15: If Christ has not been raised, "we are found to be false witnesses, because we testified of God that He raised Christ." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, the apostles are not false witnesses about the work of God&lt;/em&gt;.

- Verse 17: "If Christ has not been raised then your faith is futile and you are still in your sins." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, we are not still in our sins.&lt;/em&gt;

- Verse 18: If Christ has not been raised, then "those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, the dead in Christ have not perished&lt;/em&gt;.

- Verse 19: If Christ has not been raised, then "we are of all men most to be pitied." &lt;em&gt;But since Christ has been raised, we are not to be pitied&lt;/em&gt;.

Lets take a deeper look at each of these 6 points together.

&lt;strong&gt;15.12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
15.13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: &lt;/strong&gt;

Everywhere the apostles went, they preached Jesus Christ and the resurrection of the dead. On the day of Pentecost, Peter declared:

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 2.32 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 4.33 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.&lt;/strong&gt;

Our faith rests upon that. If Jesus is dead, then our system of belief is dead, our foundations have crumbled beneath us and we might as well go out and eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. We are here this morning because Jesus Christ rose from the dead!

Some religious sects today teach that our Lord Jesus Christ never came out of the grave in His material body. They admit His existence as a disembodied spirit, but deny His physical resurrection. That is pagan. That is not biblical. They are not talking about another Jesus, not the Jesus Christ of the Bible.

Despite the greatest efforts of the religious and secular opponents of Jesus Christ to put an end to all of this Jesus nonsense, they guarded the tomb to prevent His disciples from coming to steal the body.

But Jesus Christ came out of the tomb on the third day as a Living Savior in a resurrected and glorified body. The Risen Living Jesus defeated death!

Because Jesus has risen from the dead, He is a living Savior. Because Jesus is a living Savior, we can have living fellowship with Him today. Because Jesus is a living Savior we can trust Him with all of our cares and needs today.

&lt;strong&gt;15.14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is useless; amounts to nothing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and your faith is also vain (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;empty, imaginary, useless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Our Preaching Is Vain&lt;/strong&gt; - Paul tells us that if Jesus is still dead, then all the preachers have wasted their words and time proclaiming the message of the resurrection. But because Jesus has risen from the dead, our faith is a living faith in a Living Savior.

The two great components of the gospel are (1) Jesus Christ was delivered up to death because of our sins, and (2) He was raised again as the token of God the Fathers satisfaction in the work that His Son accomplished.

&lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/index.cgi?q1=Hebrews+7:25&amp;amp;t1=en_nas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 7:25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus said in &lt;strong&gt;John 14.6 I am the way, the truth, and the life&lt;/strong&gt;. And His bodily resurrection from the dead vindicates His claim that Jesus is The Way to The Father. Jesus is The True revelation of The Father. Jesus is The Life of The Father.

It is through The Risen, Living Jesus that we come to The Father for salvation.

&lt;strong&gt;John 1.12 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; to them that believe (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;adhere to, trust in, rely fully upon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) on His name. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;We Are False Witnesses&lt;/strong&gt; - Paul tells us that all those who spread the Christian message of salvation through the crucified and resurrected Jesus are liars if Jesus did not in fact rise from the dead.

But because Jesus is a risen, living Savior, my preaching this morning is not in vainit is full, meaningful, valid, valuable, and significant.

&lt;strong&gt;15.16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;futile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); ye are yet in your sins (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;under the control and power of sins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;

As if things couldn't get any worse, Paul now tells us that if Jesus isn't alive, then we are still lost, hell bound and still in our sins this morning.

If Jesus is still dead and in the tomb, then we cannot be justified and we are still lost in sin this morning! If Jesus is dead today, then we are without a redeemer and we are all headed to Hell!

But the gospel of the grace of God is the proclamation that Jesus Christ left Heaven above, was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and died on the cross to pay for the sins of the world. It doesn't stop there! The Bible goes on to say that He rose again the third day for our justification.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 4:25&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Jesus was delivered for our offences (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;He paid the full price on the cross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), and was raised again for our justification (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God raised Jesus from the dead to validate our forgiveness and justify us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

Let me repeat that for you. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the proof that His death is sufficient to cover all our transgressions. His resurrection is the guarantee that all who come to The Father through Him will be justified in the sight of God forever.

&lt;strong&gt;15.18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;we are to be pitied more than all men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;

If it is true that there is no resurrection from the dead, then the very system of belief that we cherish so deeply is nothing more than just another religion that offers life and hope to no one.

Paul is saying that if Jesus did not rise from the dead, then every child of God has wasted his/her life in living for Jesus. We have a believed a lie and are headed to Hell!

If the Bible lied about the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, then you and I can believe nothing this Book tells us!

But because Jesus is a risen, living Savior, Who reigns as king forever, all our obedience, all our love, all our self-denial is not just not-to-be-pitied, but is positively enviable.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 4.17,18 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&lt;/strong&gt;

Because Jesus is a risen, Living Savior, rather than cower in fear and doubt in living for Jesus Christ, Paul would end this chapter with the words.

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 15.55-58 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?-- The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

Since this life is just a brief prelude to eternal life with Christ and ever-increasing joy with Him, he or she is no fool who is sold out for Jesus Christ. Your life of radical, risk-taking, self-sacrificial love is not to be pitied or in vain beloved.

Pity not them that live for Christ and will rise with Christ. Pity those people who live for and love this present world.

&lt;em&gt;He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 1.21 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For to me to live &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Christ, and to die &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; gain.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul saw the risen Lord Jesus and his life was never the same. This one time enemy of Jesus was now a follower of The Risen Jesus.

Because Jesus Christ IS The Resurrection and the life, His resurrection is the guarantee of our resurrection  that's what "first fruits from the dead" means.

The first fruits were the first pickings of the harvest that showed that there is a harvest  this resurrection signifies the certainty of our resurrection.

Although our study this morning is referring to the future resurrection of our bodies, the gospel of Jesus Christ gives to us the promise of resurrection life now.
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
The bible talks about the resurrection of the just and the unjust.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 24.15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;John 5.28,29 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus said that on judgment day, He will separate the sheep (just) from the goats (unjust).

The sheep will live with Him forever in glory. The goats will be separated from His presence forever in hell.

&lt;strong&gt;John 10.27-30 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My Father, which gave them Me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand. I and my Father are one.&lt;/strong&gt;

If you hear His voice calling you this morning, that is His sovereign grace tugging on your heart.

Faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ is connected with the new birth:

&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 1.3-5 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, Who are kept by the power of God &lt;em&gt;through faith&lt;/em&gt; unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&lt;/strong&gt;

I urge you to place your trust in Jesus Christ today.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;15.50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. &lt;/strong&gt;

The phrase&lt;strong&gt; flesh and blood&lt;/strong&gt; in this context refers to our bodies as currently designed for life on this planet.These bodies, which are subject to sickness, disease, injury, and one-day decay, are unsuited to heaven. &lt;strong&gt;Corruption&lt;/strong&gt; cannot &lt;strong&gt;inherit incorruption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, &lt;/strong&gt;

The Greek word translated &lt;strong&gt;mystery&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;musterion&lt;/em&gt;. Musterion speaks of something that has previously been hidden, but is now made known, or revealed.Paul is telling the Corinthian Christians and you and I today, something that we could not have known by reason or research. We could not have known this mystery unless God revealed it to us by The Spirit.

What is that mystery that Paul is speaking about here? &lt;strong&gt;We shall not all asleep, but we shall all be changed. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;We shall not all sleep&lt;/strong&gt; is the biblical way of describing the physical death of a believer. Remember that Jesus uses the word sleep when He said to His disciples, &lt;strong&gt;John 11.11 Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;This sleep referred to here is not some kind of soul sleep or suspended animation as the Jehovah Witnesses and other cults teach. Paul made it clear that &lt;strong&gt;to be absent from the body means to be present with the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2Co/5/8/s_1083008"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 5:8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)

&lt;strong&gt;We shall all be changed&lt;/strong&gt;. Paul is telling us that not all Christians will sleep, or die. There will be a "final generation" who will be transformed into resurrection bodies at the return of Jesus before they ever face death.

&lt;strong&gt;15.52 In a moment (&lt;/strong&gt;Gr. &lt;em&gt;atomos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;), in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;In a moment&lt;/strong&gt;, speaks of the smallest particle of time. The word &lt;em&gt;atomos, &lt;/em&gt;from which we get our word atom, means that which cant be divided. It identifies the smallest possible undividable unit of time.

The Greek word for &lt;strong&gt;twinkling&lt;/strong&gt; refers to any rapid movement. One writer suggests it would be like a sixth of a nanosecond, or the time that it takes for light entering the iris to reach the retina. A micro-second is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one thousandth of a micro-second. And the twinkling is one sixth of a nanosecond, and it refers to the sudden transformation of raptured believers, both the dead in Christ, and those who are alive at His coming. This change is going to happen that fast.

This mystery of the alive in Christ being taken up into glory along with those who have died in Christ is recorded in..

&lt;strong&gt;1 Thessalonians 4.15-18 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;precede&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.&lt;/strong&gt;

When the trump of God sounds, the Lord Himself Jesus Himself shall descend from heaven. The dead in Christ shall rise out of the graves first; then, we who are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet with them in the clouds. Well be changed immediately without going through the death process at all.

The Greek word for the English words &lt;strong&gt;caught up &lt;/strong&gt;is &lt;em&gt;harpazo&lt;/em&gt;. It means &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;o seize, carry off by force; to claim for oneself eagerly; to snatch out or away. &lt;/em&gt;

It is the same word used in the following passages.

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 8.39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord &lt;em&gt;caught away&lt;/em&gt; Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 12.2-4 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one &lt;em&gt;caught up&lt;/em&gt; to the third heaven. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) How that he was &lt;em&gt;caught up&lt;/em&gt; into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 12.5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was &lt;em&gt;caught up&lt;/em&gt; unto God, and to his throne.&lt;/strong&gt;

This remarkable, instant, gathering of Christians unto Jesus in the clouds has been called &lt;em&gt;the rapture&lt;/em&gt;, after the Latin word for &lt;em&gt;caught up&lt;/em&gt;.This rapture like experience may be what happened to Enoch and Elijah when both were caught up to heaven without dying.

&lt;strong&gt;15.53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. &lt;/strong&gt;

Notice the word must it is emphatic. We cannot go to heaven in the bodies that we are in now.

&lt;strong&gt;15.54 So when (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not if&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory (Isa 25.8). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? (Hosea 13.14)&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the saints are raised from the dead and taken up into glory, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; death shall be swallowed up in victory.

Satan seemed to be victorious when Jesus was on the cross and when He was laid in the grave. But it was Jesus, not Satan that was victorious on the cross and over the grave.

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 2.14,15 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2:14,15 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.&lt;/strong&gt;

Because of the victories won by Jesus on the cross and over the grave, death is no longer a source of dread or fear for the child of God. Christs resurrection overcame the grave, and one day ours will also.

Paul quotes two Old Testament passages to confirm this.

&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 25.8 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hosea 13.14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;

Swallowing is a very strong verb. Death is swallowed up; this speaks of a complete destruction. Death is not merely harmed, it is not really leveled, it is not simply destroyed, it is consumed in an absolute and total victory. Note the 4 I wills in &lt;strong&gt;Hosea 13.14.&lt;/strong&gt;

The incredible wonder of this triumph gives rise to a taunt in verse 55. This is taunting&lt;strong&gt;. O death, where is your victory? O, death, where is your sting?&lt;/strong&gt; Death is likened to a poisonous bee sting or snakebite that kills.Deaths sting is gone because Jesus Christ bore the sting for us on Calvary. Jesus Christ swallowed up the power of death when He rose from the dead!!

&lt;strong&gt;15.56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. &lt;/strong&gt;

The Law, good in itself, was given to weak and sinful people. When the Laws moral claim encounters sinful human nature, it activates sin. Rather than bringing salvation, it brings condemnation.

&lt;strong&gt;The sting of death is sin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;And the strength of sin is the law.&lt;/strong&gt; The law defines sin. The law of God is the standard that reveals we are sinners. The law declares that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

Jesus Christ satisfied every breech of the law. Jesus Christ paid the full penalty for every law ever broken. He paid the full price the law demanded. The wages of sin is death, He died to pay the wages. All sin having been dealt with, death has no more sting.

My dear friend, the very smallest unforgiven sin in your life has the power to kill your soul and separate you from God eternally. So unless you have received the forgiveness of your sin through faith in Jesus Christ, when death hits you, it will sting you with its eternal kill power. ON the other hand, if you have received the forgiveness of your sin by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, then sin is not an issue and death has no sting.

The gospel of Jesus Christ proclaims that by virtue of the resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ, we have victory over sin, victory over the Law, and victory over death.

John would write in the Revelation: &lt;strong&gt;Revelation 21.4 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 John 5.4,5 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;15.58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.&lt;/strong&gt;

Paul's doctrinal declarations always led to practical directives, and this chapter's conclusion was no exception.

The word &lt;strong&gt;therefore&lt;/strong&gt; in verse 58 is the practical application of knowing and remembering verses 51-57.

Jesus Christ has come. Jesus Christ has died for you. Jesus Christ took all your sins on himself. Jesus Christ satisfied the demands of the law for you. The sting of death is removed. There is no condemnation. No hell. No fear. Though your body may be laid in the grave, Jesus Christ will come. The trumpet will sound. This mortal body will put on immortality and this decomposing, decaying body will become imperishable. Death is swallowed up in a great, blood-bought, Christ-wrought victory. To die is gain. Away from the body, at home with the Lord.

THEREFORE Church..

&lt;strong&gt;Be Steadfast&lt;/strong&gt; means to keep moving forward. Keep on going and dont let up. Dont be given to fits and starts. Put your hand on the plow and dont take it off till your work is done. Steady movement forward till your work is done.

&lt;strong&gt;Be Immovable&lt;/strong&gt; means dont get knocked over by sudden blows. Keep your balance. Stand strong and unshaken when the rains come down and the floods come up and the winds blow and beat against your house. Be like a boulder that cant get washed away. Be like a tree that cant get blown down.

&lt;strong&gt;Always abounding in the work of the Lord &lt;/strong&gt;means &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;do lots of it. &lt;strong&gt;Abound in&lt;/strong&gt; means overflow with. Fill your days with things that count for Christ. Read your bible and pray every single day without ceasing. Reach out to the lost with the love of Christ and the gospel. Reach out to one another. Serve The Lord in any way that you can with all the strength that you can with gladness. Let your light shine before men for the glory of God.
&lt;h3&gt;One of the devil's most effective weapons is the fiery dart of discouragement.&lt;/h3&gt;
Sometimes we become apathetic about serving the Lord because we dont see any results. Even if it seems that what youre doing for Him is not making a very big impact, know this: Your labor is not in vain. Just be faithful to do what He has called you to do, and leave the results to Him.

&lt;strong&gt;2 Chronicles 15.7 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6.9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 6.10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 6.19,20 What? know ye not (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;have you forgotten?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.&lt;/strong&gt;

Your life does not belong to you to do as you will. Your life belongs to Christ and to do His will.

The follower of Jesus Christ is taught in Scripture to establish his or her priorities in life around the biblical principles of Scripture. Outside of your family and work responsibilities, how do you steward your time? God given talents? Finances?

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 12.1,2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

This is the only proper response to all that Jesus Christ has done for us. Have you presented yourself fully to God? Are you being conformed to the God centered image of Christ or the self-centered image of this world? Is your mind being transformed by the Word of God, or by the words of men? Are you seeking the will of God or your own will?

Have you been born again?

&lt;strong&gt;John 3.3-8 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.&lt;/strong&gt;

Jesus was explaining the necessity of the new birth. People dont enter the Kingdom by living a better life, or by observing rituals, but by grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.

Just like each of us have had our birth into this world. We need a new birth to be born into the kingdom of God. Will you trust Christ today and embrace Him as Lord of your life?</ns3:encoded>

Revelation 4:8-10  ... the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, ... And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
 
     It is hard to believe that today is the first Sunday of December 2017. Our theme for this years Christmas series is, God, Our Glorious Redeemer. Oh how I love that name, Redeemer! That name has so many shades of color to it. It is a word that basically means to buy or deliver something or someone out of slavery or bondage. It is a word that was used in the book of Ruth to describe how Boaz (a type of Jesus Christ) redeemed Ruth, a Gentile woman (a type of the church), becoming her goel, or kinsman-redeemer. As we work our way through this series this year, it would benefit you personally to take the time to look up all of the passages of Scripture that mention the word Redeemer or redeem, for therein The Holy Spirit will reveal to you a beautiful portrait of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ.
     
Being The Lords Supper morning, we begin our series by coming to the communion table where we are reminded by the bread and the cup of the sacrifice that Jesus paid to redeem us from the debt of sin, the slavery to sin, and ultimately, from the very presence of sin. Prayerfully consider inviting people that you have been sharing Jesus with to one of the Sunday services, for faith (saving faith) comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. May Gods Spirit open our hearts and our eyes to see more clearly the glory and majesty of God, our Glorious Redeemer like never before.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Wonderful Grace</title>

		<ns3:encoded>
Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

When we were born again it was not a reward for good behavior. It was a free gift bestowed upon us through the Lord Jesus Christ. This sweet message of grace is not for one second to be interpreted as being cheap. No! The price paid to make available the grace of God was the cross of Calvary. Having predetermined this plan of salvation (Revelation 13:8), God chooses to forgive completely (Psalm 103:12) all those who believe the gospel. Saints, having begun by grace we should continue in grace. This life-changing gospel is so wonderful that we, like our brother Paul, should not even count our earthly life dear when compared with the gospel of His grace.

But lets face it; there is just something in our human nature that wants to earn salvation, which is one reason why legalism and cults are so abounding. But human works never can nor ever will be the basis of our salvation, though they certainly will be some of the fruit of our salvation. For you see, grace is actually the position in which the believer in Jesus Christ stands (Romans 5:2). This grace, of course, comes by only one Man, Jesus Christ. Grace is not a license to sin, but rather a release from its dominion in our lives (Romans 6:14). The sum of all that we are can only be attributed to the grace of God (1 Corinthians 15:10). The sum of all that we will ever need to face lifes storms is the grace of God (2 Corinthians 12:9).

So then what is the definition of Gods grace? Its Gods Riches At Christs Expense. Its the merciful kindness extended by God to the fallen family of man through faith in Jesus Christ. The grace of God and the Person of Jesus Christ are one and the same.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Touch of Jesus Heals</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Mark 6:56  And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

When I am reading my bible, I try to place myself into the context of what I am reading, especially when I am reading the gospels. When I see Jesus moving and ministering, whether it be to an individual or amongst the multitudes, I am particularly overwhelmed by what happens whenever He touched them, or they touched Him by faith. 

In our journey through the gospel of Mark, we have come to the place where multitudes of sick people were brought to Jesus, and as many as touched the border or hem of His garment were made whole. Put yourself in that scenario. You are in the grip and pain of some sickness, you touch the hem of Jesus garment, and you are immediately healed! 

Luke 6:19 tells us that virtue, or it could read power, healing power, emanated from Jesus to those who touched Him. In Matthew 8, a series of physical healings are recorded, and The Holy Spirit tells us that it was in fulfillment of Isaiah 53:4,5: Surely he hath borne our griefs (diseases, sicknesses), and carried our sorrows (pain, suffering): yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded (pierced) for our transgressions, he was bruised (crushed) for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes (wounds, scourging) we are healed.

     These physical healings were recorded in the context of the Great Atonement Chapter. Jesus did these healings before He went to the cross. Praise God for His atoning sacrifice for all of our sins and transgressions! The greatest need of every sinner is the personal experience of the saving grace and love of God when we call out to Jesus to forgive us of our sin. But as sure as Jesus will save your soul from the debt and slavery to sin today if you call upon His Name, I believe that when you touch Him by prayer with your pains, your sicknesses, your sufferings and your diseases, He will touch you in a most remarkable way, for the Scriptures declare that before the cross, on the cross and after the cross, by His stripes, we are healed. Selah.

		<title>The Gospel Of Gladness</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>David declared, Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and wine increased.  Have you noticed a real absence of genuine gladness in Gods people lately?  When preparing to come to church on Sunday, or at any other time, do you proclaim, I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord?  
     	
Im amazed how much place is given in Scripture to the words glad, gladness, and gladly.  Check it out for yourself!  When Jesus ministered on earth, the common people heard Him gladly.  After Peters message in Acts 2:14-40, some gladly received his word and were baptized.  The apostle Paul, having experienced the grace of Christ in his life, could even most gladly...boast in (his) infirmities!  The very gospel itself brings glad tidings of good things!  How true the proverb, The hope of the righteous shall be gladness.  
     	
Now, dont misunderstand me; I realize the difficulties that we all deal with in this life.  Life has its share of sorrows and disappointments for sure, but the gospel of Christ says a lot about the good things to come to urge us on.
     	
We must determine to be glad in the Lord.  We are told to serve the Lord with gladness.  In fact, the heavens and the earth are commanded to be glad.  
     	
May the oil of gladness that was upon Christ Himself be poured out upon you this week as you walk uprightly before Him.  When you see the grace that God has poured into your life today, look up to Him and be glad.

		<ns3:encoded>In todays passage, the apostle Paul listed his credentials for being a genuine follower of Jesus. Among them was a time that friends let him down the side of a city wall in a basket to save his life. From beginning to end, Paul faced afflictions and opposition as he preached the Gospel and made disciples. We may not be called by God to face the same obstacles as Paul, but Jesus calls all of us to deny ourselves daily, pick up our crosses, and follow Him. Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter eleven, verse sixteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study.

		<ns3:encoded>We are all called to endure difficulties and forgo conveniences for the cause of Christ and to care for one another. If there is one word that is sorely lacking in todays church, it is the word sacrifice. It describes the action of giving up oneself for the cause of Christ and for the sake of others. Because Paul knew the sacrificial love of Christ for him, he sacrificially cared for the Church. What are your sacrificial credentials of being a follower of Jesus Christ? Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his study of this chapter.

		<ns3:encoded>By Gods grace, Paul had visions and revelations that were so spectacular that he could not even write them down. But Gods grace also sustained him when he was buffeted by a thorn in the flesh. Likewise, every child of God has good and bad days. However, as followers of Jesus, we can count on His grace to sustain us in and through every season. Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter twelve, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses one through ten.

		<ns3:encoded>Whether you are experiencing revelations from God or thorny attacks from the enemy, know this: Gods grace is sufficient for you, and His strength is made perfect in your weakness. However, it is not enough to be able to articulate the theological implications of the doctrine of grace. Grace is a Person, and His name is Jesus Christ.  Put your life in His hands today! Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter twelve, verse seven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses one through ten.

		<ns3:encoded>False teachers in Corinth were criticizing and even slandering the Apostle Paul. After Paul apologetically wrote in defense of his calling and ministry as an apostle, he then wrote of his love for the people of Corinth and his concerns for their spiritual condition. He was grieved that many of them had remained defiant in their sin, and ignored his apostolic admonitions to repent.  Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter twelve, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses eleven through twenty-one.

		<ns3:encoded>Every church congregation contains a mixed multitude of possessors and mere professors of faith in Christ. Paul voiced his concern for those whose lifestyle did not match their alleged testimony of having experienced the regenerating power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As you listen today, consider this question: Is your life bearing the fruit of regeneration by grace, through faith in Jesus Christ? Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter thirteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his discussion of the first six verses.

		<ns3:encoded>This is the first messagein our 2015 Christmas Series entitled, The Incarnation of Jesus Christ.The word incarnation comes from the Latin meaning, &lt;em&gt;in the flesh&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the Incarnation refers to the Christian doctrine that God, Who is spirit, took upon Himself human flesh and came as the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ.

The Gospel of John describes the incarnation this way:

&lt;strong&gt;John 1.1,14 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us&lt;/strong&gt;

The WordThe One Who was eternally face to face with God the Father as the second member of the Trinitybecame a man, the man Jesus Christ. Thats the incarnation. The second member of the Trinity entered into history. The Creator entered creation.And His coming was for the purpose of redeeming sinners.

&lt;strong&gt;Luke 19.10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 3.1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/148025135"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Who is this serpent? The fullest answer is given in &lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev%2012.9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 12:9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&lt;/strong&gt;

So the serpent in the garden is the devil (&lt;em&gt;which means slanderer&lt;/em&gt;), and Satan (&lt;em&gt;which means accuser&lt;/em&gt;), and the deceiver of the whole world. Jesus calls him the evil one (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2013.19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 13:19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and the ruler of this world (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2012.31"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 12:31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2014.30"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14:30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2016.11"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16:11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Pharisees call him Beelzebul, the prince of demons (&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 12:24&lt;/strong&gt;). Paul calls him the god of this age (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%204.4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 4:4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and the prince of the power of the air (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%202.2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 2:2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

He is subtil, which means that he is he is cunning, crafty, and shrewd.Note that the serpent tempts Eve by: (1) emphasizing Gods prohibition, not His provision; (2) reducing Gods command to a question.

Take note of the fact that the serpent, which is elsewhere in Scripture called the devil, &lt;em&gt;is a created being&lt;/em&gt;. Satan is not Gods equal.

It is interesting that at both the beginning and the end of Scripture, the Bible pictures Satan as a snake or dragon at war with God for the dominion of the earth and the human race.

&lt;strong&gt;3.2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. &lt;/strong&gt;

Note here that Satan (1) casting doubt upon Gods sincerity and defaming His motives; and (2) denying the truthfulness of His threat.When a person is being tempted to partake of anything that is forbidden by God in Scripture, you can be sure that Satan is lying to them about two things. (1) the nature of sin and (2) the nature of God.

By challenging Gods Word, Satan plants a doubt in our minds, and then, he comes in for the kill. Satan is always suggesting that God is holding something from you, something that will be good for you.

Remember beloved, Gods Thous shalt nots or any other prohibitions are for our protection.

There are 3 specific places in Scripture where Satan is recorded as talking.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One is here, where &lt;em&gt;he is slandering God to man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The second is in &lt;strong&gt;Job 1&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;he is slandering man to God&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lastly in the gospels, where he is talking to Jesus, The God/Man, and is defeated. How? By using the sword of The Spirit and quoting with the answer to each temptation, "It is written!"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. &lt;/strong&gt;

The immediate effect of sin was the awareness of their nakedness, guilt and shame before God. They experienced death, which is separation from God.Pastor Jon Courson calls the fall of Adam as THE Adam bomb!Their first thought was to cover up their sin, thus they covered themselves with an apron of fig leaves.Because each and every one of us here today are sinners, we all need to deal with the problem of guilt.

It is not surprising that the enemy of our souls offers many counterfeit solutions.So we must be careful to answer from the Bible alone the question, How does God deal with my guilt? The fig leaves of human solutions to guilt will not suffice in the day when we stand before the living God. The story of Gods coming to that first guilty, fig-leaf-clad, hiding couple, shows us Gods solution to guilt.

The answer to man's sin, guilt and condemnation is not good works, rituals, Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Calvinism, Arminianism or any other ism. The &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;Answer to the sin problem of man is the Sinless, spotless Lamb of God, Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;3.8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Where are you? &lt;/strong&gt;Of course God knew where they were. He asked the question in order that they might acknowledge their sin. God asks the same question to every single person here today, Where are you?

&lt;strong&gt;3.10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;I heard thy voice and was afraid - &lt;/strong&gt;This is an important stage in dealing with sin.

&lt;strong&gt;3.11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? &lt;/strong&gt;

Again, God did not ask this questions because He did not know the answer. He asked them in order that Adam and Eve would confess and admit their sin and guilt. There can be no forgiveness of sin or restoration with God apart from confession of sin.

&lt;strong&gt;1 John 1.7-10 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us&lt;/strong&gt;

We do not deal with our guilt by hiding from Him, but by coming to Him and acknowledging our sin. And for those who come to God this way, Jesus said:

&lt;strong&gt;John 6.35-37 I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen Me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3.12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. &lt;/strong&gt;

Adam blames Eve, and by implication he also blames God. Blaming others for my sin is not repentance; its an excuse.

&lt;strong&gt;3.13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. &lt;/strong&gt;

Eve blames the serpent and his deception. Eve uses the same blame game speech, as did her husband.

Someone has said, &lt;em&gt;If the best of men had his innermost thoughts written on his forehead, hed never take off his hat.&lt;/em&gt; We all know the corruption that is in our hearts. We are all sinners by nature, by choice, and by delight.

&lt;strong&gt;3.14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: &lt;/strong&gt;

God does not ask the serpent what did he do, because there is no redemption for the devil and the angels that followed him in his rebellion against God and His throne.

&lt;strong&gt;3.15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&lt;/strong&gt;

In Christian history, verse 15 has been called the &lt;em&gt;Protoevangelium&lt;/em&gt;, the first announcement of the gospel. The first promise of the Redeemer to come to rescue man.

&lt;strong&gt;I will put enmity. &lt;/strong&gt;Notice that at first it looks like the warfare will be between two seeds: between your seed and her seed. But the very next words tell us something different: He shall bruise your head. Who is He? Answer: the womans seed. Whos head will He bruise? Answer: the serpent himself.

The singular seed points to one man, Jesus Christ.

&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 3.16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.&lt;/strong&gt;

This seed of the woman presupposes the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.As we will explore a bit more next week, if Jesus is not born of a virgin, then He is simply just another sinner like you and me.Beloved, your salvation is inextricably woven with the virgin birth. No virgin birth, no deity. No sinless life, no sacrificial death. No sacrificial death, no salvation. Jesus was born of a virgin, in order that by grace through faith in Him, we might be born again.

God says that the day is coming when Satan will be defeated and removed from the earth. The perfect Seed of the woman, Jesus Christ, struck that decisive blow, when He died on the cross.

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 2.14,15 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it&lt;/strong&gt;

This is one of the reasons why the eternal Son of God had to become a manbecause it was the Seed of the woman who would crush Satan.

&lt;strong&gt;Romans 16.20 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2.14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. &lt;/strong&gt;

Gods answer to human sin, rebellion, and folly is His only begotten Son who will come through the daughter of Eve. There will be a battle between this Son and Satan, and although the Savior Son will be wounded, the Deceiving Dragon will be defeated. That was the promise. Ever since that terrible day when sin entered the world, Gods promised the birth of His Son, Jesus Christ. The one Who would conquer Satan, sin, death, hell, and the wrath of God to be our Savior, be our forgiver, be our deliverer.
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
Gods question &lt;strong&gt;Where are you&lt;/strong&gt;? told Adam two things:

(1) Youre lost, Adam; and, (2) Ive come to find you. Every person needs to know the same two things.

Every single human being that is born into this world is lost without Jesus Christ.

That term that the bible uses to describe unsaved man is that we are lost. Not simply misguided. And the promise of the Incarnation is that &lt;strong&gt;Jesus Christ came to seek and to save those who are lost.&lt;/strong&gt;

God doesnt seek us because we deserve it. We deserve His judgment, but He seeks us to save us. Thats grace!
&lt;h3&gt;An illustration and invitation&lt;/h3&gt;
An American woman, returning from Europe with some perfume she had bought, had gone to a great deal of trouble packing the bottles so that they wouldnt be spotted by customs officials. An official started going through her luggage. He had nearly finished searching the last suitcase when the womans small daughter clapped her hands and said excitedly, Oh, Mommy, hes getting warm, isnt he? You can try to hide your sin from God, but be sure your sin will find you out!

Let me once again direct Gods first question to you: &lt;strong&gt;Where are you?&lt;/strong&gt;

Are you hiding, afraid of God, because of sin in your life? Maybe youre trying to cover your sin with the fig leaves of your good works or some ritual that you went through when you were a baby.The Bible says that God is graciously calling, Where are you?If you will come to Him with a broken and contrite heart and confess your sin, this is what God says He will do:

&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 1.13,14 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins&lt;/strong&gt;.

That is how to deal with your guilt, your sin and your shame.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Mystery Of The Incarnation</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 3.15,16 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. &lt;/strong&gt;

These two verses embrace the heart of the mission and message of the church. The heart of the church's mission comes in verse 15. The heart of the church's message comes in verse 16.

In his first letter to Timothy, Paul declared that one of his reasons for writing the pastoral epistles was in order that those who profess faith in Christ might know how to &lt;strong&gt;behave themselves in the house &lt;/strong&gt;(family) &lt;strong&gt;of God&lt;/strong&gt;. This term "behave" speaks of a constant consistent pattern of life, not an occasional spark of interest in Christ or the things of His kingdom. What Paul is saying is that one of the primary responsibilities of the church is to teach Gods people how to behave ourselves as a member of the household of God both inside and outside of the four walls of the building.

Genuine Christian living is meant to be incarnational, not just intellectual. Relational and practical, not just social and conversational.

He then goes on to remind Timothy that the church of the Living God is the pillar and ground of the truth (&lt;strong&gt;3:15&lt;/strong&gt;). This church exists to uphold the truth of The Living God. Jesus said, "&lt;strong&gt;I am the way, the truth and the life," John 14:6&lt;/strong&gt;.

He is truth incarnate so in the same sense that we uphold the truth of God's Word, we uphold the truth of God's Son, don't we? That's what we're all about. We exist for that purpose, that's the heart of our mission. When we sing songs, we sing songs that articulate the truth we believe. When we teach classes, we teach the truth. You come on Sunday morning and I preach to you, you come back on Sunday night and you hear the Word of God again. Why? Because we are here to uphold the truth. That's what we are all about.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/149583141"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-2826 alignright" src="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/rayviolawatchwhite.png" alt="rayviolawatchwhite" width="240" height="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We know from the outset of this letter that Ephesus had begun to abandon sound doctrine. Some of those professing faith in Christ had begun to cultivate lives of ungodliness under the banner of grace. False teachers were teaching error that was causing the faith of some to go shipwreck. All kinds of problems had ensued in that church since the departure of the Apostle Paul in the early days.

Paul left Timothy there after his first imprisonment and told him to set things the way they ought to be. How important it is for the church to stay Word-centered, Spirit-led, God-exalting and driven by the love of Christ in all that we do. When an individual is a podcast fed follower of men rather than a sitting at the feet of Jesus Christ, he or she eventually becomes an echo of that personality's quotes and views than thus saith The Lord.

Several years ago the phone rang at the office of a relatively small local church in a major city in the USA where an eager caller asked this question: I heard that the famous preacher and author so and so is going to be at your church this Sunday, is that true? The receptionist wisely replied tongue in cheek, &lt;em&gt;I cannot promise that any man will be here next Sunday. But The Word of God will be taught, and know that The Living Christ will be here, and we believe that those things are incentive enough for you to attend&lt;/em&gt;. Click.

Paul summarizes some of the great pillar truths this way:

&lt;strong&gt;1 Timothy 3.16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. &lt;/strong&gt;

This passage contains six points that form one of the most concise summaries of the truth of the gospel. The phrase &lt;strong&gt;without controversy&lt;/strong&gt; translates a Greek term that literally expresses that which one confesses. Thus, it might be rendered &lt;em&gt;undeniably&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;most certainly&lt;/em&gt;. It is a declaration of absolute confidence. These are non-negotiable truths of the gospel.

&lt;strong&gt;Mystery. &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word for &lt;strong&gt;mystery &lt;/strong&gt;does not refer tothat which is mysterious and incapable of being understood.Rather, in Bible terminology, the word denotes that whichwas formerly obscured, but which has now been announcedthrough the gospel of Christ. It has to do with the unfoldingof the heavenly plan of salvation.

Perhaps the most comprehensive discussion of this matter is to be found in Pauls epistle to the Ephesians, where the apostle declares that the mystery, &lt;strong&gt;which in former generations was unknown to men, has now been revealed through Spirit-inspired apostles and prophets&lt;/strong&gt;, so that those who read the New Testament record can clearly perceive and understand the heavenly plan of redemption which is fulfilled in the work of Christ (cf. 3:1-12).In context, the mystery of &lt;strong&gt;godliness &lt;/strong&gt;refers to the truths of salvation and righteousness in Christ, which produces godliness or Christ like behavior in those who embrace the truth in their hearts.

&lt;strong&gt;God (He) was manifested in the flesh. &lt;/strong&gt;Not sinful, fallen human nature, but His humanness&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;

Certainly Paul is teaching the virgin birth of Christ, but he is also speaking of Christs existence before His incarnation.This reference is clearly to the Deity of Christ, who manifested the invisible God to mankind&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;John wrote:&lt;strong&gt; John 1.1,2; 14 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. 14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. &lt;/strong&gt;

This affirmation of the deity of Christ was in direct conflict with certain gnostic ideas of ancient times that asserted that Christ could not have possessed a body of flesh, since flesh was intrinsically evil.This denial of the humanity and deity of Jesus Christ is labeled by John as the spirit of the antichrist.&lt;strong&gt;1 John 4:2,3 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. &lt;/strong&gt;This Jesus is The One Who in the beginning was God, was with God, and Who made all things. He came into this world as a little, helpless baby. Indeed great is the mystery of godliness.

The New Testament reveals that Jesus was manifest in the flesh for the following reasons:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He became flesh so that men might see a visible commentary on Deity. John affirmed that Christ came to declare the nature and will of The Father. Thus, to view the Lord was to comprehend something of the nature of His heavenly Father &lt;strong&gt;John 14:8,9 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He became flesh to identify with us. Having lived in human form, and thus been subjected to temptation, Jesus is able to effectively function as our high priest, hence, come to our aid when we are tempted&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2:17,18 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are temptedHebrews 4:15,16 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He was manifested as man to provide us with a model for living&lt;strong&gt;John 13.12-17 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Since it is impossible for Deity, as a spirit being, to die, Jesus Christ became flesh so that He, as The Lamb of God, might be subjected to death, hence qualified to put away sins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 2:21-25 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he threatened not; but committed himself to him that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;your souls. &lt;/strong&gt;

Twoexamples that Jesus provides for His church are that of suffering for righteousness sake and servant hood.

&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 John 3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. &lt;/strong&gt;

Finally, we read in &lt;strong&gt;1 John 3:8 For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. &lt;/strong&gt;The devil destroys lives. Jesus came to give us life and that more abundantly.

&lt;strong&gt;Justified by the Spirit. &lt;/strong&gt;We must note that the word &lt;strong&gt;justified &lt;/strong&gt;does not suggest that Christ at one time was sinful, hence, at some point, was pardoned or justified from sin. That cannot be the meaning, because Jesus knew no sin and committed no sin.

The term denotes a vindication. Though Jesus was manifested in the flesh, and put to death in the flesh by His enemies, God Almighty vindicated the Lord, raising Him from the dead.&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.Romans 1.4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Seen by angels. &lt;/strong&gt;Angels had an interest in the Savior from His conception to His ascension. An angel announced the conception to Mary. Angels proclaimed His birth to the shepherds. Angels ministered to Him after His temptation in the wilderness. An angel strengthened Him in His agony in the Garden. Angels proclaimed His resurrection at the tomb. Angels addressed the disciples at Christs ascension. Angels testified to his resurrection &lt;strong&gt;(Mt 28:2) &lt;/strong&gt;and to His ascension back to heaven &lt;strong&gt;(Ac 1:10). &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Proclaimed among the nations (&lt;/strong&gt;nations&lt;strong&gt;). See Matt. 24:14 26:13 28:1920; Mark 13:10; Acts 1:8.&lt;/strong&gt;God's way of saving souls is by creating faith in men's hearts is by the proclamation of the gospel.

There is only one gospel message for all people and every nation, and that one gospel is that&lt;strong&gt;1 Cor. 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. Acts 20.20,21 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Believed on in the world. &lt;/strong&gt;Repentance and faith in God is the only means that God has ordained for every person to receive the gift of eternal life.&lt;strong&gt;Acts 16.30-32 Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 8.35-38 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Taken up in glory. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acts 1:9 And when he had spoken these things, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;received him out of their sight. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Mark 16.19 So then after the Lord had spoken &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on the right hand of God. &lt;/strong&gt;

Christs ascension and exaltation showed that the Father was pleased with Him and accepted His work fully.Today Jesus Christ is at Gods right hand. You have a Lawyer in heaven, Jesus Christ our Advocate!!

&lt;strong&gt;Closing Exhortations: &lt;/strong&gt;

The Mystery of the Incarnation givespurpose and meaning for the existence of His church

The most significant event in all of human history was when the living God took on human flesh and lived among us asthe Lord Jesus Christ to bear our sins. And since His bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven, His church is now commanded to go into the entire world and preach this gospel to every creature.

Thus, the task that The Lord Jesus has given to the church is more important than the tasks that are given to all the governments and universities of the world combined. There is nothing to compare with the mission and message of the church. Since the eternal destiny of every person on earth depends on his or her being rightly related to Jesus the coming King and Judge of all the earth, nothing could be more crucial this hour than the message given by Christ to the church! Do you believe that? How do you know that you believe it?

It is because of the mission and message given to the church that makes every aspect of being a part of the church important. The primary mission and message of the church is not about joining a religious social club. The primary mission and message of the church is the greatest news on earth, not the greatest show on earth. What a staggering job description! Nothing could be of greater importance!

&lt;strong&gt;For those who have never received Christ as Lord of theirlives&lt;/strong&gt;

The Lord Jesus Christ is not just one the good ways to Heaven. Jesus is not even the best way to Heaven. &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven.&lt;/em&gt;Jesus is not just one more Savior. If Jesus is not the only Savior, then Jesus is no Savior at all because He said He was the only one. And if He said Hes the only one, and Hes not the only one, then Hes a liar, and a liar is nobodys Savior.

&lt;em&gt;If the gospel we preach does not exalt God, magnify Christ, and humble man, it is not the gospel. &lt;/em&gt;Steve Lawson

Apart from Jesus, there is no salvation.

&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 45.21-24 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the Lord? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.&lt;/strong&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>Some of the most familiar and happy words of Christmas are these:

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men (Luke 2:1114)

There are important questions in life that we need to ask and answer correctly: Is there a God?How can I know Him?Is there life after death?Do heaven and hell exist?If so, where will I go when I die?

At the root of all these important questions is a crucial question that every person must answer. In fact, every person reading thiswill answer this question, either now or at the judgment.

The question you must answer and respond to correctly is, Who is Jesus Christ?&lt;!--more--&gt;

The correct answer to this question will answer all of the questions I just asked:

Is there a God? Jesus came to reveal the Father to us.

How can I know Him? You can only know God through His Son Jesus Christ.

Is there life after death? If so, where will I go when I die? Jesus tells us authoritatively about the reality of both the way to heaven and how to avoid hell.

The proclamation of the incarnation of Jesus Christ isTHE answer to all of these questions.

For unto you is born this day . . . The birth of Jesus Christ happened on a day; a very particular day in human history. Not a day in some mythological, imaginary story, but a day when Caesar Augustus was the emperor of Rome and Quirinius was governor of Syria (vs.1,2).

It was a day that was planned in eternity before the creation of the world. The whole universe with its untold billions of galaxies was created for this glorious day when God would become man for the purpose of redeeming man from the debt, penalty and eventual presence of sin.

Speaking of Jesus Christ as Creator, The Holy Spirit would say: Col. 1:16 For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesall things were created through Him and for Him.

For him! All of creation was made for Him. All creation was made for this day of His appearing. Gal. 4:4,5 When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law. To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons

The birth of Christ happened in the fullness of time. The perfect time appointed by God before the foundation of the world.

..in the city of David the birth of Christ happened in a real city. Not in Narnia. Not in Middle Earth. Not in a galaxy far, far away. The city still exists today.

The citys name is Bethlehem Luke 2:4, Joseph also went up from Galilee . . . to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem.

Bethlehem, six miles from Jerusalem. Bethlehem, the city where Jesse lived, the father of David, the great king of Israel.

Bethlehem, the city that Micah prophesied over: Micah 5:2 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting

The birth of Jesus Christ, The Eternal God, happened in a real city called Bethlehem like the city you live in.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior.

The word Savior is only used two other times in the gospels. In Luke 1:47, Mary said that she rejoiced in God my Savior. The only other place is in John 4:42 where Jesus is called the Savior of the world.

A Savior. If you have ever sinned against God (and we all have), then you need a Savior.

The angel said to Joseph, Matt. 1:21 You shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.

Only God can forgive sins against God. That is why God sent the eternal Son of God into the world, because He is God. Thats why Jesus said, The Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Therefore, a Savior was born to save His people from their sins.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ.

Christ is the English for Christos, which means, anointed one, which is the meaning of Messiah.

Just after Jesus birth, in Luke 2:26, 30, 38, both Simeon and Anna bore wit- ness to the fact that this child was the Lords Christ, the Savior, and The Redeemer.

Jesus Christ is the long-predicted, long-awaited Anointed One. Jesus Christ is the final anointed king. Jesus Christ is the final anointed prophet. Jesus Christ is the final anointed priest.

2 Cor. 1:20 In Him all the promises of God are yea and Amen.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. The Lord or ruler, the sovereign one, the mighty God, the everlasting Father. The Lord of the universe.

For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end. (Isa. 9:67)

&lt;strong&gt;Christmas in Summary&lt;/strong&gt;

The joyful news that we gather to celebrate today is that on a day, at the perfect fullness of time, in the perfect prophesied city, a Savior was born, who was Jesus Christ, the Lord.

The fact that these events happened means that God exists and that He truly broke into human history in the birth of Jesus in fulfillment of many prophecies.

The fact that God sent Jesus as a Savior implies that people without the Savior are alienated from God and desperately need to be reconciled to Him through the forgiveness of their sins.

Jesus did not come as a nice man offering a new philosophy about life. He did not come as a great moral teacher, offering some helpful insights on how to live a happy life. He came be the Savior and only hope for sinners!

&lt;u&gt;Two Great Declarations were made on the night of Christs birth. &lt;/u&gt;

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

This brief hymn is called the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, from the first words of the Latin Vulgate translation (meaning Glory to God in the Highest).

The coming of Jesus Christ is the greatest revelation of the glory of God.

The message of Jesus Christ is the proclamation of the gospel of peace from the Prince of Peace.

&lt;strong&gt;Peace with God &lt;/strong&gt;

The most basic need that every human being has is to have peace with God. How does that happen?

The key passage here is Romans 5:1: Therefore, being justified by faith [theres the pivotal act of believing], we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Justified means that God declares you to be just in His sight by imputing to you the perfect righteousness of Jesus. And God grants that justification by faith alone: Since we have been justified by faith (Rom. 5:1).

And the result of that justification is peace with God. Because of Christs perfect sacrifice for our sin, Gods anger at us because of our sin is put away. On the basis of faith in Christ, God adopts us into His family. He will never be against us. He is our Father and our friend.

Our works does not justify us in the sight of God. We are not justified in the sight of God by baptism or any other ritual or ordinance. We are not justified in the sight of God by church membership. We are justified by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.

May The Spirit of God impress in our hearts and minds that sense of amazement that in spite of all your sins, God has forgiven you of al of your sin by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.

I was reading on the Internet last week how a number of years ago, a toddler fell down a narrow well. Her mother went looking for her as soon as she realized she was missing and was horrified to hear her daughters voice coming from this deep, dark shaft. Fire fighters and other rescuers soon swarmed on the scene. News media arrived and for hours the attention of the nation was riveted on the desperate attempt to rescue that little girl before it was too late.

That little girl didnt need anyone to give her some ideas on how to live a happy life. She was doomed if someone didnt save her from death. The most important news that that desperate mother could hear in that situation was, The rescuers have saved your daughter!

When someone is lost and within hours of death, the only news that will matter to them is that The Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has come Who can rescue them from eternal damnation.

Jesus didnt leave heaven and come to this earth and go through the suffering of the cross just to give you a boost or a few tips on how to have a happy life. He came to rescue sinners from the debt and penalty of eternal separation from God because of our sin.

Only Jesus Christ can save you from the penalty of Gods wrath because of your sins.

&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion &lt;/strong&gt;

So the crucial question that you must answer and respond to correctly tonight is this: Who do you say that Jesus Christ is?

One day, everyone will get it right, for the apostle Paul says Phil. 2:10-11 at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. On judgment day, every single human being is going to bow his or her knee and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

But some will bow on judgment day in terror as they hear the Lord say Matt. 25:41 Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. For whatever reason, these people refused to believe the gospel and bow their heart and knee to Christ before they died.

For those who bow their heart and knee to Christ before they die, The Lord will say to them on judgment day Matt. 25:34 Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

Have you believed the gospel and bowed your heart and knee to The Lordship of Jesus Christ? By the grace of God, you can respond to Christ right now! Confess your sinful condition and receive Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord.

For he wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

			<ns0:comment_content>PRV, 

Thank you so much for this series. We also appreciate the servants behind the "digital scene" that bring the joy of Jesus to us every morning. 

Praise the Lord.

John 10.14-16  I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
 
     One of the most beloved Psalms is Psalm 23. Take a moment to read it. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

     David, the man after Gods own heart, is giving his personal testimony that The Lord is his shepherd. Our Glorious Redeemer, Jesus Christ, is The Shepherd of all who call upon His Name, for whosoever shall call upon The Name of The Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13) Jesus said, My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them Me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand. (John 10:27-29)

     In a world that is filled with uncertainty and insecurity, those who know Jesus Christ as Redeemer and follow Him as their Shepherd can face each day with assurance and confidence, for our times are in His hands. Selah</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>And as in Luke 15, even if we are that one lost sheep of the hundred, He seeks us, finds us, puts us on His shoulder, and takes us home. His amazing grace will never forsake us. Thank You Jesus for being our loving Shepherd. 

God bless,

		<title>From Birth To The Throne</title>

Christmas time is a message that primarily focuses on the birth of Christ and His first coming. But we can never forget that the birth of Christ and His Second Coming are inseparable doctrines of Scripture that are equal components of the gospel message. This morning we want to focus on the future worship and adoration of The Lord in glory. When we read about The Lord's exalted position in glory, it is intended to inspire us to lift our hearts and praises to Him. The redeemed of The Lord are gathered around the throne, worshipping and magnifying God The Father and The Lamb. The scene is breathtaking! Multitudes proclaiming, 'Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.' (Revelation 7:12)
     
Oh that we might join that heavenly choir who are also declaring, 'Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.' (Revelation 7:10) Christmas is, and always has been, a salvation message. It's a time to reflect on both the first and second coming of Christ. As we know all too well, our days on this earth are few, and full of troubles. We are living in a world that has been stricken and smitten with the scourge and consequences of sin. But by the grace of God, and the blood of The Lamb, Jesus Christ, we have overcome this world. And in glory, God will finally wipe away all of our tears once and for all. Until then, it is that future aspect of the Hope of the gospel that is to inspire us to trust in The Lord with all of our hearts, and worship Him in Spirit and in truth. Remember, Emmanuel, Jesus Christ, is God with us both now and forever, Amen. </ns3:encoded>

2 Corinthians 4:6  For God, Who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

The very glory of God is revealed in The Lord Jesus Christ. The writer to the Hebrews declares that Jesus Christ is the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person. If you want to know what The Almighty God is like, study the life of Jesus Christ. Jesus said to His apostle, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. (John 14:9) Jesus Christ was an incarnation of every attribute of God. His love was glorious. His mercy was glorious. His beauty was glorious. His praying was glorious. Every miracle was a display of His glory.

The real Christmas message is that God The Son became man and dwelt amongst us. The purpose of His incarnation was to save His people from their sins. (Matthew 1:21) Jesus mission on earth was a mission of redemption. At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:10-11) To bow the knee to Jesus and confess Him as Lord brings glory to God. For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to Whom be glory for ever. Amen. (Romans 11:36)</ns3:encoded>

John 3:16,17  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

The purpose of the incarnation was decreed before the universe was created (1 Peter 1:18-20). The apostle John tells us that the Child Who was born existed from the beginning (John 1:1,2,14). Jesus Christ is the Uncreated One Who became a man to accomplish the redemptive purpose of God. He was seen. He was handled. Jesus was The Eternal Word of God made flesh. Every word that Jesus spoke was God speaking. Every miracle or wonder that Jesus performed was God working. John tells us that Jesus does not just give us eternal life. Jesus Himself is eternal life! John also tells us that Jesus was manifested for three purposes:

One, And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; (1 John 3:5a).

Two, For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. (1 John 3:8b)

Three, That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. (1 John 1:3)

     When Jesus came into this world, God came into this world. And He came to take away your sin, destroy the works of the devil, and - most wonderful of all - He came to bring you back into fellowship with The Father. Jesus IS The Gift of God. Thats Christmas. Receive Him as Lord and crown Him as King of your heart and life today. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Scripture makes it clear that our assurance of salvation does not lie in any work that we do. Salvation comes only by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus. We can only draw near to God because of Who Jesus is and what He did for us.  However, it is equally clear that when we trust in Him, we should see the evidence of Gods Spirit bearing fruit in our lives. Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter thirteen, verse two, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses one through six.

		<ns3:encoded>Some say that the body of Christ is the most glorious dysfunctional family on earth. Gods people are perfectly redeemed, yet they dwell in imperfect bodies that have been corrupted by sin. Paul addressed this dysfunction in his letter to the Corinthians. He told them that he was praying for their perfection, or, more accurately, their progressive maturity in the Lord. Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter thirteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses seven through fourteen.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul exhorted the Corinthian congregation to be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. Each one of us is working out (not for!) our own salvation with fear and trembling. Fortunately, God gives us resources to empower and encourage us: His grace, His love, and communion with His Holy Spirit. Please open your Bible to Second Corinthians chapter thirteen, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his study of this chapter and this epistle.

		<ns3:encoded>"When Israel was in spiritual darkness, Isaiah prophesied that a Light would arisea special child would be born! Jesus Christ was that child. Not only will He deliver us, He IS our
Deliverance and our Light. Behold the mystery: This child called Emmanuel, which means God is with us, was born to a virgin in Bethlehem. Please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter nine,
and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his special Christmas series entitled A Child Is Born."

		<ns3:encoded>Glory to God for His redemptive plan to ransom us from the works of the devil! Jesus came to do for man what we could never do for ourselves. He came as a child, born of a virgin, to become the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of the world, and to redeem all who believe in His death and resurrection by His grace. Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola continues his discussion of Isaiahs amazing prophecies about this miraculous child and Gods love for us.

		<ns3:encoded>When Jesus came into the world, God came into this world, and He did so for three reasons. He came to take away your sin, destroy the works of the devil, andmost wonderful of allHe came to restore fellowship between humans and the Father. Jesus IS the gift of God; that is Christmas! Receive Him as Lord, and crown Him King of your heart and life today!  Please open your Bible to First Peter Chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray discusses verses eighteen through twenty.

		<ns3:encoded>The word manifest means to make visible, known, or to show openly. Jesus Christ came to openly show the nature and will of God on earth. In other words, Jesus did not come from heaven to earth only to fulfill Gods redemptive plan, He also came to earth to reveal to all mankind what His Father is like. Jesus is the manifestation of God in human flesh. Please open your Bible to First John, chapter three and listen as Pastor Ray Viola discusses verses five and eight.

		<ns3:encoded>If a person does not comprehend the truth of the Gospel of grace, then they will either think that they are good enough for God to save, which is self-righteousness, or they will look at their sinful thoughts and deeds and become so guilt-ridden that they will doubt that they can even be saved. The Gospel tells us to look to Jesus for salvation, not to ourselves. Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study entitled Jesus-The Perfect Manifestation of the Will of God.

		<ns3:encoded>Immanuel is a strong and mighty tower, the righteous run into it and are safe. Immanuel is hope to the hopeless and strength to the weak and weary. Immanuel means God is with us, because, when Jesus was born of a virgin, God came down to live among mortal men, and to bring life to those who are dead in their tresspasses and sin. We pray that you will find hope and comfort as you listen today to the first portion of Pastor Ray Violas Christmas Eve message from twenty sixteen.

		<ns3:encoded>Until the day that the Lord takes His people home, He knows that Satan will be hurling darts of discouragement at them. That is why Jesus gave us His promise that He would never leave us nor forsake us. Christians today have His Holy Spirit dwelling in them, but even before He gave His people the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Scripture has many passages that show God comforting His people in hard times throughout history. We pray that you will find hope and comfort as you listen to the conclusion of Pastor Ray Violas Christmas Eve message from twenty sixteen.

		<ns3:encoded>The first biblical reference to the title of Savior comes from the lips of David, the shepherd king. The Hebrew word for savior comes from the verb yasha, which means to avenge, deliver, help, save, or get victory. For every believer in any age, that is our God: not military might, not education, not prosperity, and not governmentnothing and no one else! Please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter nine, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola discusses verses six and seven.

		<ns3:encoded>The Church enjoys intimate fellowship with Christ, our Savior for He is our Husband, and with great joy and anticipation we look forward to His return. Our Savior is God Himself, Who desires that all people would be saved. Jesus came to this earth to save sinners, not to destroy mens lives. The salvation that Jesus freely offers to all includes deliverance from Gods wrath. This salvation and deliverance is only a prayer away! Please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter nine, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes His message on verses six and seven.

		<ns3:encoded> The start of a new year causes many people to begin a new diet, start a new exercise program, or commit to being more financially responsible by creating a budget. These changes ususally result from the realization that something has got to change after reflecting on the past year or years of ones life. Please open your Bible to Haggai chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his message entitled Consider Your Ways, which he presented to his congregation on New Years Day, 2017.

		<title>Giving Glory to God</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Daniel 5.21 "but the God in whose hand is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified."

We must reject the thinking that giving glory to God is "just for Christians." How dangerous it is for any human being to think this way. The passage above is referring to the king of Babylon, Belshazzar. He was obviously not a God-fearing man. He was a sensual polytheist who worshipped the gods of silver and stone. Out of total disregard for Jehovah, he holds adrinking party where he uses the sacred things that his father took out of the temple in Jerusalem. God wrote a message for Belshazzar on the wall. Oh, it definitely had a specific message for him regarding the fall of his kingdom. But that handwriting has a message for every human being. There are consequences when we refuse to live for the glory of God. Read the entire chapter and take a deep breath.

In the New Testament, there is an account of another pagan king by the name of Herod. We read, "And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost." Lightning strikes again! A man gifted by God but not giving him glory is eaten by worms. I think of all the End Zone celebrations, Grammy Awards, Nobel Peace Prize winners. The countless things that are done and boasted about every minute of every day that fail to give glory to God.

Dear family of God, to whom much is given, much is required. May God's precious Spirit cause us to breath, eat, drink, speak and live for the glory of God, through Jesus Christ today.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The need for divine illumination</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Proverbs &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;14:12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof [are] the ways of death.

We by nature choose things that seem right, but lead to death. That is why we need divine illumination in life. Repeatedly we read in the proverbs warnings about choosing the wrong friends or the wrong path. In counseling his son, the father in Proverbs says "my son, walk not thou in the way with them ( those who do not fear God) refrain thy foot from their path." Why? "Because they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices."

The harvest of hanging with the wrong crowd is a harvest of deceit and disappointment. Now, you can learn that the hard way if you choose. You can ignore the warnings of Scripture and live your life doing what seems right to you, but you will reap a harvest of shame and despair. The way of the transgressors is hard. Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

How then do we know the right way to live? The right people to keep company with? By reading and listening to God's Word. Hear the words of our Heavenly Father, beloved. "He [is in] the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth. The way of the LORD [is] strength to the upright: but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity. The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel [is] wise."

Do not be a self-confident fool. You cannot afford the cost. When deciding what to do, what to say, where to go, don't follow your instincts, pray and follow the way of The Lord. Remember, a man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. (Galatians 5:1 KJV)

Every human being has this basic desire to be free. The key is how you define freedom. Freedom is the purpose of Jesus Christ coming to this earth. Jesus Christ, in coming to die for sinners, has also come to set us free from things that hold us in bondage. But just like the serpent lied to Eve in the garden, the devil lies to mankind about the truth of the gospel. You see beloved, Christ sets us free from the debt, bondage and corruption of sin. But to the natural man, the things of God are deemed puritanical and rigid. Holiness and purity is not as "pleasurable" as feeding the flesh with forbidden fruit and desires.

The world system apart from Jesus Christ loves darkness. They call good evil, and evil good. Thus, when the gospel is proclaimed as the power of God to set you free. The devil goes on the offensive with lies regarding the true nature of either religion or the lusts of the flesh. Truth is, beloved, religion holds people in bondage to rituals that can never set a person free from the debt of sin. Paul said to the wavering Galatians, but now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

The deeds of the flesh, though pleasurable for a season, can only bring a person's life into bondage and despair. Peter writing to those who were being taught by the false teachers that "if it feels good, do it", while they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.

In Christ alone is forgiveness and fulfillment. The tempter will not retreat in his attempt to lure into his web of deception by appealing to your flesh beloved. Preach the gospel to yourself. Only whom The Son sets free is free indeed.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Timothy 1.15-17 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
&lt;div&gt;Good morning, saints! We tend to remember the things we should forget, and forget the things that are most important. Our verses today are of prime importance. They need to be stored in the vault of our minds and the hard drive of our souls. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. This is not only speaking of salvation past, but salvation present. Praise God for His saving grace and mercy that has opened my heart to the truth of the gospel.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But salvation is not only a "once and for all" gift, it is an ongoing work in process.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We are still totally dependent upon God for the grace, mercy and power to deliver us from the vanity of the world and snare of sin. Apart from God's Spirit, we are incapable of fighting the good fight of faith. Scripture talks about the excellency of the power being of God, and not us. And what is the purpose or goal of this present aspect of salvation? That we be holy and reflect the image of Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world. Thanks be unto God for His longsuffering towards His children. Thank God for the supply of His Spirit that He has given unto us to live for Christ and His glory.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Beloved, the God Who has saved us is the God Who is patiently and powerfully saving us in order that we might be His ambassadors in a world that is desperately in need of hope. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;/div&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>1 John 4.8 The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.

The fallen world system has taken the sacred things of God and twisted their meanings. In the Greek language, there are two different words that are translated into the English word love. One is eros, and the other is agape. Eros is a physical, sensual kind of love. Within the context of marriage between a man and a woman, eros is by God's design. But the vast majority of what the world calls love is lust and self-centered.

My time with you this morning is to remind you that real love is from God. The love that describes God is an unselfish kind of a love. It is an others centered, giving kind of a love. Eros on the other hand is a selfish, taking kind of "love." As followers of Jesus Christ, we are called to walk in the God kind of love. A love that reflects the person of Jesus Christ. Thus, the kind of love that is to be found in the church that is born of God is a giving kind of a love. A love that is generous and kind. A love that mis helpful. A love that is a giver, and not a taker. This kind of love comes from God and brings glory to Jesus Christ. This "God kind of love" is to inspire and motivate all that we do.

The highest expression of worship is a life that is filled with and demonstrates the love of God. This kind of love is shed abroad in our hearts as we abide in The True Vine, Jesus Christ. Which definition of love describes you, eros or agape?</ns3:encoded>

		<title>A tale of two branches</title>

		<ns3:encoded>John 15.1,2 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

Jesus is the True Vine. He is the Source of human and spiritual life. In this beautiful parable of Jesus, the True Vine, and His branches. We see another "sub parable." The tale of two kinds of branches. These two branches represent genuine believers and make believers. Please note, dear ones, that the distinction made between the two branches is crystal clear. True believers abide in Christ, and by virtue of union with Him, bear fruit. Make believers make a profession of abiding in Jesus, but bear no fruit.

Salvation is a work of God's grace in our lives. So is fruit bearing. Good fruit is the result of genuine conversion and abiding in Christ. It is impossible to bear Christ-like, Father-glorifying fruit apart from a vital union with Him. A living union with Christ is absolutely necessary to bearing fruit; without Him, there is nothing.

And what is the fruit that real branches bear? "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." Any claim to abiding in Jesus that fails to bear this fruit (albeit imperfectly) is a false claim. The source of fruit bearing is abiding or continuing in Christ. "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed." Those who are not abiding will simply not continue following Jesus. "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."

Which branch are you, my friend? There are only two kinds of branches. Fruitful or fruitless. Those who abide in Jesus, and those who do not. Saving faith is a fruitful faith, because The One Who saves us is The Vine in Whom we bear fruit for the glory of God. Embrace and abide in the True Vine Jesus Christ today as Lord of your life. Begin to bring forth that God glorifying, joy producing fruit in your life. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Timothy 6.17-19 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

We hear a lot of talk these days about the importance of making wise investments. The financial gurus tell us the things to consider when preparing to make such investments. God's Word is not silent about this subject. Today's verses are the "tip of the iceberg" on this matter. What can we learn from them?

1- Do not put your trust in uncertain riches. In this world, financial security cannot be guaranteed. Be wise in handling what God gives you, but let your money be invested in a kingdom that outlasts the NY Stock Exchange.

2- Put all of your trust in the Living God. Invest your life in knowing Christ. Enjoy the things that He richly gives you today.

3- Invest your life in doing good and helping others.

Investments made for life on earth are at best temporal. Investments made for eternity will last forever. I am not advocating a prayerless, careless usage of God's means of providing for you in this life. I am advocating a holy recklessness in living for and investing in the kingdom of God. Only Godward investments pay eternal dividends.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Unfeigned Faith</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>2 Tim 1.5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

What does it mean to have an unfeigned faith? It means to have a faith that is sincereandhonest, a pure of mixture of motives or desires. It means to have a faith in Jesus that is not just an outward display of godliness, rotten on the inside.

When James writes about the wisdom that comes from God, He describes as being first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. Thus, an unfeigned faith is pure and without hypocrisy. It means what it says, and its actions stem from a pure motive. It is not hiding a self-driven, secret agenda beneath the disguise of devotion to Christ.

Peter describes the fruit of new birth this way. He says that "ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently." Again purity and unfeigned or sincere love. Not a duty love or an obligation of love. But a love that comes from the love of God planted within. When Paul's apostleship was challenged, he defends his ministry by saying that is life was an open expression of pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned.

Let us never forget that the fruit of the new birth is not the ability to rattle off bible verses or heartless busyness in church activities. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Bitter And Sweet</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Revelation chapter 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, John is told to eat the scroll containing the prophetic word of the coming judgment of God. The net effect it had upon him was that it was both bitter and sweet (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;verses 9,10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The Old Testament prophet Ezekiel had almost the same experience (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Ezekiel 2:8-3:3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). This is a typical experience for the born again disciple of The Lord Jesus Christ who feeds his or her soul with the word of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Without question, Gods Word is a source of great joy and rejoicing (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jeremiah 15:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Gods Word is sweet indeed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Psalm 119:103&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). However, this same word that provides such joy and sweetness is also the cause of sorrow and bitterness. When the prophets of God brought to the nation of Israel a message of warning from Him, their rejection of Gods truth had the effect of great bitterness on those who delivered Gods truth (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Lamentations 3:15,16; Ezekiel 21:6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). We see this same effect upon Jesus Himself as He looked over the city of Jerusalem that had rejected Him, even after God had sent them prophet after prophet to warn them about such a thing (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Luke 13:34,35, 19:41-44&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Such is true for you and me as well. The sweetness or bitterness of our lives is determined by how we respond to Gods Word. If we sow to the flesh in rejection of Gods Word, we reap corruption, but if we sow to The Spirit in response to Gods Word, we reap life everlasting (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Galatians 6:7,8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Likewise, if we choose to only listen to Gods Word, but refuse or fail to apply its truth, we are building our lives on sandy, shifting soil that will end up in destruction. However, if we choose to hear Gods Word and apply it to our lives, we will be building our lives upon a rock that will enable us to withstand the storms of life (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Matthew 7:24-27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). God has given to us His Word (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16-17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), and whether or not our lives are bitter or sweetened by it depends upon our response. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Oh precious family, may we heed those familiar words of James about hearing and doing what God says (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James 1:21-25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). That does not mean that our lives will be rosy and without trials (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John 16:33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) or spiritual warfare (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 Peter 5:8,9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). It simply means that at the end of the day, we have the assurance that God is looking out for us and will show Himself mighty on our behalf (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Chronicles 16:9a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). It doesnt get any sweeter than that! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Mercy in Life&amp;#039;s Dungeons</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.
Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
Lamentations 3.55-58

If you read the verses in the early part of this chapter, you learn that Jeremiah was not in a good place physically, mentally and emotionally. What seems to have troubled Jeremiah the most was the fact that he did not see his troubles and persecutions as coming from the cruel Babylonians, but from the hand of God Himself. Many of God's people have wrestled with that same issue. If I am following The Lord and doing His will, why am I in this dungeon. Is that you this morning beloved? Prior to our texts this morning, we find some of the most often quoted Scriptures in all of the Bible. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

It is from that recognition of God's mercies that Jeremiah calls upon The Lord out of the low dungeon, or pit. What is mercy? Well, among other things, mercy is not getting what we deserve. If we got what we deserved as rebellious sinners, we would all be consumed. But, because God's compassions fail not, you and I are in Christ this morning. Like Jeremiah, we are redeemed people who need ourselves in dungeons in life. Like Jeremiah, we cry unto God out of those pits.

What does God do? He draws near. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. What does God say? Fear Not. He does not wave a magic wand, and you come out of the dungeon in the form of a rabbit. Following Jesus is not magic. It is a mystery that often bewilders us and leaves us with more questions than answers. But this we can conclude. God is good. His mercies are new this morning. When fear grips your mind and emotions, remember the dying Savior Who redeemed your soul on the cross and hear Him say to you, fear not child, I Am The Lord of all of your dungeons.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>ISAIAH 7.14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His Name Immanuel.

ISAIAH 9.6,7 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and His Name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

Isaiah is quoted directly in the NT over 65 times, far more than any other OT prophet, and mentioned by name over 20 times. Isaiah has been called by some scholars The Evangelical Prophet.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/148805616"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-2826 alignright" src="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/12/rayviolawatchwhite.png" alt="rayviolawatchwhite" width="240" height="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
It is estimated that this prophecy of the coming of The Messiah was written about 750 years before Christ was born. This prophetic sign was given to King Ahaz as an assurance of Judahs hope in the midst of adversity. It therefore had an immediate, historical fulfillment. But its usage by The Holy Spirit in the gospel of Matthew shows that it also had a far-reaching messianic fulfillment.

This prophetic announcement, coupled with its literal fulfillment in the gospels is an indisputable proof that Jesus Christ is indeed the Messiah. Matthew would write that Jesus Christ the Messiah is Emmanuel, or God with us.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Matthew 1.18-23 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His Name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

Matthew quotes from the LXX, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. The Greek word used in the LXX in Isaiah 7.14 is &lt;em&gt;parthenos&lt;/em&gt;, which means virgin. Not simply a young unmarried woman. It is no miracle for a young woman to have a child. But it is indeed a miracle for a virgin to have a child.

Jesus was conceived through a miracle of the Holy Spirit rather than through the sexual involvement of a man. Mary was a virgin and remained a virgin until after she gave birth to Jesus (Mt 1:18, 25).

In other words, in the incarnation of Jesus Christ we see the divine union of Deity in human flesh.

Philippians 2.6-11 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

&lt;em&gt;The birth of Jesus leaves us with no doubt about how seriously God takes the sin we so instinctively tend to minimize&lt;/em&gt;. Paul Tripp

Emmanuel. The clearest manifestation of God to us is revealed in The Lord Jesus Christ.

Colossians 1.15 Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God.

Hebrews 1.3 Jesus Christ is the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person.

In The Lord Jesus Christ, Emmanuel is with us. Jesus is God in us, with us, and for us. Christmas is all about Christ, for without Christ, there is no Christmas.

Isaiah 9 is one of the most remarkable messianic prophecies in the book of Isaiah. For it contains the prophecy that a child is coming Who would breaking into the darkness and bringing His life giving light.

Matthew 4:1317 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet (Isa 9.1,2), saying, The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

The region of Zebulun and Naphtali was devastated by Assyria in 732 b. c. They are now the first to see the great light of Gods deliverance in Jesus. Jesus is the difference between light darkness; life and death.

Jesus proclamation repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand is a prophecy that the heavenly kingdom will one day arrive in all its glory. But the citizens of that kingdom is limited to &lt;em&gt;o those who repent, and acknowledge Him as Lord&lt;/em&gt;.

Jesus saidLuke 5.32 I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.

Before His ascension into glory, the command of Christ to His apostles wasLuke 24.47 that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His Name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

1 John 4.9,10 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

Isaiah 9 begins with the words, unto us a child is born (&lt;em&gt;This is viewing the birth of Christ from the human side&lt;/em&gt;). Unto us a child is given (&lt;em&gt;This is viewing the birth of Christ from the divine side&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;u&gt;His Name will be called:&lt;/u&gt;

Wonderful Counsellor- Some translations see two distinct characteristics here. Others see them combined in one.

Wonderful- This word that is translated wonderful is a word that is used to represent something unusual or extraordinary. It describes the essential glory of who Jesus is meant to fill us with &lt;em&gt;wonder&lt;/em&gt;. Jesus is Wonderful. He fills your heart and mind with &lt;em&gt;amazement&lt;/em&gt;!

Jesus is our Counsellor- He counsels us through His Word. Through prayer. Through fellow believers.

Mighty God- Can there be a more straightforward declaration of the deity of the Messiah? In &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Isa/10/21/s_689021"&gt;Isaiah 10:21&lt;/a&gt;, the prophet uses the exact same phrase to refer to YahwehJesus Christ is God incarnate, the omnipotent One. In the Person of Jesus Christ all the fullness of GodHis nature and characterwould exist in bodily form (Col 2:9; cf. Jn 1:1, 14). In other words, Jesus Christ would be fully God and fully man.

Everlasting Father- Expresses Christs fatherly care. In the Hebrew the phrase is literally the Father of Eternity. This speaks of the purpose of his coming. Jesus is before, above, and beyond time. He is the possessor of eternity. He is eternally like a father to his people. This is not a statement about the &lt;a href="https://www.jesus.org/is-jesus-god/holy-trinity/"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt; but about the character of our Lord. The name Father is not in conflict with that of the First Person of the Trinity. Jesus said to Philip, He who has seen Me has seen the Father (John 14:9).

Prince of Peace- The reign of Christ in earth will be characterized by shalom, health, well-being, prosperity, happiness, and cessation of enmity.

The atoning death and resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ makes provision for sinners to have peace &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;God. Likewise, the indwelling of His life and character through the Holy Spirits work in our lives empowers us to abide in Christ and experience the peace &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; God.

Jesus said to His disciples, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you (John 14:27).

Surrender to His will and submission to His Word will bring inner rest, as we allow the peace of God to rule in our hearts (Col. 3:15), that is, to let Gods peace act as umpire 1) over decisions that would trouble you, 2) overruling doubts that would disturb you, and 3) overthrowing the Adversarys lies that would defeat or deter you.

Perfect peace is available when the heart and mind keep focused on Gods promise, power, and presence. Trust Him (Is. 26:3)

Of the increase of His government there is no endRevelation 20 cites a thousand year earthly reign 6 times.

The literal fulfillment of Isaiahs first coming prophecies about Jesus Christ gives assurance that prophecies of Christs second coming will also see literal fulfillment. He provides us with details of unique aspects of Christs future kingdom on earth not found elsewhere in the OT or NT.

(ESV) Isaiah 11.6-10 The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, and the calf and the lion and the fattened calf together; and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den. They shall not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of The Lord as the waters cover the sea.

But the reign of the Messiah will not last merely 1,000 years, though the millennium is a special aspect of His reign. There will be no end to the reign of the Messiah, and He will rule for all eternity. His princely rule shall perpetually increase and be unlimited.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lets get personal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given.

John 3.16 For God so loved the world, that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life

1 John 3.8 For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.

Jesus not only came to redeem man from the debt of sin. He also came to destroy the works of the devil.

Not only was a Son was given to pay the price for our redemption. He was also sent to deliver us from the kingdom and power of darkness. Jesus came to bring man back into fellowship with God.

What the gospel makes clear is that in our sin we are dependent on the gift of Gods righteousness to us, since as sinners we are not righteous in and of ourselves.

Rom. 3:2324 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus

&lt;em&gt;You cant celebrate the birth of Jesus and hold on to your righteousness. If you were capable of being righteous, Jesus wouldnt have had to come&lt;/em&gt;. Paul Tripp

&lt;em&gt;The only works of righteousness that serve to justify a sinner are the works of Christ. &lt;/em&gt;R.C. Sproul

The prophecy of the incarnation clearly reveals that we need Christ to bear our sin and God to credit His righteousness to our account.

2 Cor. 5:21 For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.

How does this happen? Acts 13.38,39 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

When Jesus came to the earth 2,000 years ago, the vast majority of the people rejected Him.

&lt;em&gt;Why did they reject Jesus and ultimately crucify Him?&lt;/em&gt;

Luke 19.14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, we will not have this man to reign over us.

They preferred to be self-ruled than governed by Christ.

John 3.19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

They loved their sin and their dark pleasures more than they loved Jesus.

Luke 12.8 Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

But others gladly received Him.

John 1.12 But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His Name.

Romans 10.8-13 if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Nothing has changed in 2,000 years.

Some reject Jesus and choose to live in their sin and for themselves.

Some receive Jesus and choose to submit to Him as Lord and Master.

One will dwell with Him forever. One will be separated from Him forever in hell. Which one of the two are you? Repent of your sin and trust Christ this morning as Lord and Savior.

		<ns3:encoded>Revelation 21:1  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

For those who have come to Christ for salvation, these words: And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away (Revelation 21:4) are among the most comforting in all of Scripture. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death (Revelation 21:8), are among the most chilling and disturbing. Obviously, not everybody on planet earth is heaven bound. But if you are reading this and you are not sure where you will spend eternity, God declares here, Behold, I make all things new. (Revelation 21:5) God also declares, I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. (Revelation 21:6) Jesus had previously told the woman at the well, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. (John 4:10)

Reader, you can be made new today. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. (2 Corinthians 5:17-21) Selah</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>The lake of fire that destroyed is death in hell is said to be the second death which brings life by reversing the first death brought on by Adam and Eve.

Some early church fathers taught love the shed blood of Jesus where to redeem everyone eventually and Taught along with this reincarnation.

I think that teaching is the correct one</ns0:comment_content>

		<ns3:encoded>Jesus second coming is a foundational doctrine of our faith. When He returns, it will be a display of His great power and glory. When He came the first time, it was as a Lamb that was offered for the sins of the world. When He comes again, He will roar out of Zion as the Lion of Judah, and His roar will shake heaven and earth. Please open your Bible to Revelation chapter nineteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola teaches us about Jesus, the Coming King.

		<ns3:encoded>On the cross, Pilate wrote, Jesus of Nazarath, the King of the Jews. When Jesus comes again, He will reveal Himself as the King of kings and Lord of lords. Everyone needs to bow their hearts before King Jesus today, and render unto Him the praises that are due His name!  May God grant us the strength and wisdom to live our lives in a way that truly shows that Jesus is Lord of our lives. Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study on Jesus, the Coming King.

		<ns3:encoded>Jesus came to pay our sin debt, but He also came to set us free from bondage to the things of this world. The most frustrated person in the world is the person that is living for themself. They work longer and harder to get more, but it is as if they are putting all that they hope to gain into a bag with holes: Nothing ever seems to change. Giving ones life to Jesus can remedy that. Please open your Bible to Haggai chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola continues his message entitled Consider Your Ways, which he presented to his congregation on New Years Day, 2017.

		<ns3:encoded>Repent is a verb, and change begins at the top. Parents, if you want your children to follow the Lord, you must follow the Lord. When one repents, and puts the Lord ahead of your own desires, God will give you this assurance: I will be with you. Please open your Bible to Haggai chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his message entitled Consider Your Ways, which he presented to his congregation on New Years Day, 2017.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul wrote a personal letter to Philemon on behalf of his runaway slave Onesimus. Just as Jesus pleads our case before His Father, Paul intereceded on behalf of Onesimus. Paul told Philemon to charge him personally for any debt that Onesimus owed him, just as Jesus bore the cost for our sin. Paul wanted reconciliation between a runaway slave and his master, which mirrors our reconcilation with God through Jesus shed blood. Please open your Bible to Pauls Epistle to Philemon, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his discussion of this short letter.

		<ns3:encoded>Hebrews 12:2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;

Salvation is a gift from God. It is not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9). But any alleged salvation that is void of works or good fruit is a counterfeit faith. This morning in our first study of 2020, we are looking at what Jesus called the narrow path that leadeth unto life (Matthew 7:14). The motive is the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

The Christian faith is not a spectator sport. It is not a passive way of life. It is a disciplined way of life, with a clear-cut goal in mind  the upward prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13-14). This life of following Jesus is not a competition with fellow believers. It is battle against the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. And to win this race, we are called upon to compete with the disciplined mindset of an athlete who is training to compete for the gold medal in the Olympic Games. You are not saved as a result of running a race, but you are crowned with rewards if you follow the rules when the event is over. This mindset is a must for all of those who desire to hear The Master say, Well done, you good and faithful servant (Matthew 25:21).

Our flesh is that traitor within. Until we get to heaven, we will be dealing with this flesh. By self- discipline we give it knockout blows. Those who pursue the interests of their souls must battle hard with fleshly lusts. The body must not be suffered to rule. It is our full assurance of the love of God and eternal life that fuels and sustains us towards this kind of living and discipline for the cause of Christ and the glory of God. And what keeps us focused when we get weary, discouraged, or depressed is looking unto Jesus Christ, The Author and Finisher of our faith, Who endured the most incredible shame and pain for us, that we might know Him as Savior and follow Him as Lord.

Run to win, beloved. Run to hear those words, Well done, you good and faithful servant. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The name Onesimus means profitable. However, when he ran away, Philemon might have been tempted to call him worthless. Fortunately, Gods grace transformed this worthless slave into someone that was indeed profitable, not only to Paul, but he would also become profitable, to Philemon. This is because he would return and serve Philemon not as a slave, but as a brother in the Lord. Please open your Bible to Pauls Epistle to Philemon, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his discussion of this short letter.

		<ns3:encoded>Before meeting Jesus, the Apostle Paul was a very religious man. However, after meeting Christ, Paul realized that all his former religious works were worthless. Moreover, compared to knowing Jesus, everything else is like dung. Remember, we have been graciously redeemed by God in order that we might know Jesus Christ and to be conformed to His image. Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter three, verse eight, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola continues his message entitled An Old Resolution for a New Year.

		<title>The cure for an anxious heart</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Proverbs 12:25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.

Let me give you a couple of other ways that this passage can be understood.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Worry weighs a person down; an encouraging word cheers a person up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, but a good word cheers it up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Both writer and reader alike are no strangers to worry and anxiety. Our flesh are prone to worry and anxiety to circumstances just like our handsreact when dangled over a fire. Neither worry or anxiety are of any value to us in either the physical or spiritual realm. They can only be cured by a good word.

That good word of course is God's Word. Word of God's character. Word of God's power and love. Word of God's promises that are yes and Amen in Christ Jesus.Beloved, be a receiver as well as distributor of God's good Word today. It is asource of cheer and gladness in times of discouragement and gloom. Is your heart heavy this morning? Read the Psalms of the day in 30 day increments. For example,If today is the 12th, read Psalm 42,72,102 &amp;amp;132 as well. Your heart will be encouragedYour soul will be relieved. Your mind will be refreshed with a Godward perspective.

May The Word of God be the medicine that you take when your heart is overwhelmed.You will be glad you did. And Christ will be magnified when your faith in Him replaces the despair and gloom of your circumstances.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>James 1.21-25 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

This morning I offer unto you a simple meditation. I am aware that there is nothing new under the sun. Nevertheless, I pass this thought along to you as a fellow pilgrim of Jesus Christ on this earth. It is both an exhortation, and a warning at the same time. We should never equate reading and agreeing with Scripture with believing and doing it. James makes this point as clear as can be. All the reading, all the memorizing, all the sermon sipping that we do is of no real value until we put into practice whatever it is God had said. Remember that when Jesus was made aware that His mother and brothers were in the crowd, wanting to talk with Him? What was His simple but profound reply? Who is My mother or brother, but those who hear the Word of God and do it. Never substitute academics for application. Selah.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Sober Up!</title>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Peter 4.7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.

Now there's a title for an early morning devotion; sober up. Peter is writing to brothers and sisters in Christ. They are going through a season of fiery trials and persecutions. He then tells them that the end of all things is at hand, or near. So in light of the fact that God's prophetic hourglass was running out, they were to be sober. The word for sober can also mean to be watchful. The idea is clear headed, not closed by intoxicants or distractions. To be sober minded means to be single minded.

Paul talks about the need to be sober-minded this was. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. According to Paul, if I fail to be sober minded, it is likened to falling asleep or being drunk. To be asleep or drunk means that I am not aware of what is really going on.

Beloved, we cannot afford to spiritually fall asleep or be impaired by things that intoxicate our minds against the call and purposes of Jesus Christ for us. We must be sober and vigilant minded because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. Do we see the consequences of refusing to be biblically sober-minded and alert in my life? We need to be biblically sober minded when going through times of testings and trials. We need to be biblically sober minded because we have an adversary who seeks to lure us into the snares of temptation in order to devour us.

Dear ones, never forget that as citizens of heaven, we are living on foreign soil. We are living in a world that is hostile towards any who desire to seriously and sincerely follow Jesus. Be sober, fellow Christian. Do not give in to the unbiblical distractions and attractions that wage war against your soul.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Psalm 18.30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

Following Jesus is not some kind of a pie in the sky experience that is free of effort or opposition. There are those whose concept of grace is cheap and anemic. They have "said the sinners prayer", but there is hunger for God at all. No desire to either hear or read God's Word. No desire to gather together with "those hypocrites" who call themselves Christians. No putting God's money to support any work of God or person in need where their alleged "profession of faith is".

Nowhere in Scripture does God promise to save the unbelieving. Nowhere in Scripture does God "perform magic" to make bad things go away, and good things appear. The just shall live by faith, and if you are not living by faith, I question whether you are just. God's ways are perfect. They were perfect for every person mentioned in Hebrews 11, even those sawn asunder, not just the "heroic" or more "famous" people. Beloved, living according to God's Word will be tried by our fallen ideas, contrary circumstances and flat out flesh-driven desires. Almighty God is only a buckler to those that trust in Him. Read the whole verse. He's not a buckler to the partying saint? The lukewarm saint? The "Christian adulterer"?

Beloved, will you trust Him today regardless of how you feel or what you see? Will you trust Him no matter how dark the pit, or how impossible the situation? The gospel is not simply a message to be believed, it is a message to be obeyed. Look to the cross for the power to obey God in the heat of the battle or in the moment of temptation or testing. Nothing can destroy those that trust in Christ, for His victory is ours. And His way is always perfect!</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Cor 15.1-8 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

There is great value in a Christian testimony. God is glorified in a life that has been transformed by the gospel. But my testimony is not the power of God unto salvation, the gospel of Jesus Christ is. As God's Spirit opens the door to testify of Christ's work in your life, speak boldly and make much of the Savior. But take note of the following truths:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fruit in my life is the testimony of Christ in my life. But the fruit in my life is not the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Worship in my life is my response to the gospel, but my worship is not the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Holiness is my life is because I am a new creature in Christ, but my holiness is not the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Joy in my life is because I know I am forgiven, but my joy is not the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Peace in my life is because God is in control, but my peace is not the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Your testimony may plant the seed of curiosity. Your testimony may cause someone to believe that you are not the same person you used to be. But only by hearing and believing the gospel does a person receive a new heart and forgiveness of sin. Thank God for your testimony, but go into all the world and preach the gospel.</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>I am a Bible teacher in Tennessee.  I am currently teaching through the Book of Acts and came across this blog in my research.  Well done.  Well said.  I hear (and have been given) a lot of training on "how to share my testimony", but see precious little instruction on "how to share The Gospel".  I dare say, far too many inside the Church can't even articulate what the Gospel is or where to find it in in the Bible.  Well done. Thank you.</ns0:comment_content>

		<ns3:encoded>James 1.22-25 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

God's Word is like a mirror. But it is a mirror that talks. What does God's mirror tell us? It tells us the will of God. It tells us the truth of God. It instructs us. Corrects us. Warns us. It gives us wisdom. Why? That we might be thoroughly furnished unto all good works and fit for The Master's use. But when this mirror is held up to our hearts, we realize that we are fallen, fractured individuals, in need of the grace and mercy of God.

You see, dear ones, God does not expose the sin in our lives to condemn us or make us feel guilty. That is the work of the devil. God exposes those things in our lives in order that we might mend our ways and bear fruit for His glory and honor. Many times when we stand in front of a mirror, we get discouraged. God's talking mirror never reveals those flaws and weaknesses in our lives to discourage us, but to embrace His saving grace. God's talking mirror would say to us, "you are My child. I've bought you with a great price. When you look into the mirror, you see you. But when I see you in the mirror, I see you being transformed into the image of Jesus Christ." The question that needs to be asked this morning, beloved, is this. When God's Word exposes that area of sin or nasty habit that distorts the image of Christ from being formed in us, do we agree with the mirror, or walk away completely oblivious to what we were shown?

When we get dressed in the morning, we look into a mirror and make sure that we look neat and proper. When you read the Word this morning, brothers and sisters, allow the Word to "iron" your wrinkled attitudes andwash your filthy mind. You are going out into the world as a representative of Jesus Christ. The talking mirror is not our enemy, but our friend whose intention is that we reflect the image of Christ and bear fruit for His glory. Mirror, mirror on the wall, conform me into The Lord of all.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>John 3.27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.

Charles a Spurgeon wrote: "The truth stated in this verse should act as an effectual cure for envy and emulation. It should also be a warning about boasting and spiritual pride. Apart from God, we are nothing and can do nothing of any eternal value. All the ability and unction to minister comes from above. The Lord is The One that dispenses His talents and gifting; The Lord is The One that adds to the church; apart from the grace and enablement of Jesus Christ, we can do nothing. We are clay pots into whom God breathes His abilities and talents. Thus, all exercising of our God-given gift is to be a display of His glory and honor. All exercise of His gifts are to be handled with prayer. Consider the following passages, dear ones.

Mt 25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Ro 12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
1Co &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;12:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
1Pe &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;4:10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 1Pe &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;4:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Pet 4.11 nails it right on the head beloved, doesn't it? The ultimate purpose for God giving us talents and abilities is in order that God in all things might be glorified through Jesus Christ, to Whom be praise and dominion forever.

Beware, beloved, when you start talking more about the instrument that God uses more than The One Who made the instrument and endowed him with the abilities that he or she has.

When it comes to spiritual gifts, Jesus did not speak fondly of the person who hid the talents that God gave them, instead of using them to bless others and bring Him glory. Likewise, to prostitute a gift of God or use it to promote yourself is a serious sin and devilish. Oh magnify The Lord with me, and let us proclaim His greatness forever!</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

When the Scripture tells us that we have been bought with a price, it is important that we understand what it means to God and to us. For in understanding the practical implication of Christs redemption, we find meaning and purpose in life, no matter what our vocation, marital status, economic portfolio or level of education.

Bought- The Greek word agorazo means to buy at the marketplace. Here is the picture of a housewife out in the morning shopping for the day. She sees some vegetables and fruit and puts down rupees on the counter. She pays the price and now they belong to her. There is another Greek word exagorazo which means to buy out of the market, and it has the thought of buying something for ones own use. However, exagorazo also means, to take goods out of the market place and never to sell them again, but rather to keep them for ones own use. This is the word which is used in Galatians &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;3:13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.

This means that Christ redeemed us so that we would not be exposed for sale again. He has paid the price, and He has taken us off the market. And by virtue of that redemption, everything that we are and every God given talent, blessing, and ability belong to Him for His use and His glory.

While Satan can never pluck us out of the Fathers Hands. Like with Job and Peter, he is walking to and fro, seeking to sift you like wheat and cause you to return to your former lifestyle. This is the gospel, beloved! You are accepted in The Beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The disaster of disobedience</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Ezek 14.23 And ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

The Sovereign Lord has told Ezekiel that because of the idolatry of His people, instead of answered prayer, they would be facing severe consequences of divine judgment. A close observance of Scripture reveals that in one sense, God measures time morally. By that I mean that there are significant places in Scripture where mans stubborn rebellion and idolatry incites the anger of God, with devastating consequences. These themes of idolatry and judgment run rampant throughout the pre-explicit books of the prophets. Does the coming of Christ and His sacrifice on the cross dismiss those who call upon His Name from observing the timeless moral law of God? Is murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false witness, covetousness and idolatry no longer a sin of of any concern before God Almighty?

Do not be deceived, beloved. Grace is not a license or approval of God to live in known sin and rebellion. "Don't judge me bro!" Is the contemporary mantra of carnal, liberal, lawless "saints" who believe that "accepting Jesus" means that I am scott free from any moral commitment to Him according to His Word.

God told Ezekiel that the devastation that he was observing among His people was not done without a cause. The judgment of God upon any person or country is caused by their live of self, which is idolatry, and repeated neglect of the moral boundaries of His Word. Nobody hardens their heart against The Lord and prospers. God's love is wrapped up God's commandments. We observe them for our good and His glory. We disobey them to our demise. May God grant a revival amongst His people to stem this flow of iniquity and idolatry within our country and His church.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The witness of God</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Philippians 1:8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Romans 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Corinthians 1.23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
How wonderful it must have been for Paul to be able to say that God was a witness to life. He called God as a witness to his prayer life. He called God as a witness as a witness of his love for his brothers and sisters in Christ. He called God as a witness for his motive of not going to visit the troubled Corinthians. Could I call God to witness as Paul did? Could you, my friends?

I have good news for you this morning, beloved. There is no reason why we should not be able to make such an appeal to the witness of God. Consider that it was only because of the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus that Paul was able to call God as witness in his life. The same holds true for us in our lives as well this morning beloved.

It is only because of undeserved grace of God through Jesus Christ that we are accepted in His presence. It is only because of the undeserved grace of God through Jesus Christ that we are complete. It is only because of the undeserved grace of Jesus Christ that have boldness and access to The Father. Meditate on those truths, beloved. We too can call God to witness when pray, and reach out in love towards others because our righteous standing before Him is in and through His Son, Jesus Christ.

But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Hallelujah!</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>2 Samuel 10.11 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.12 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.

The people of God were surrounded by the enemies of God. Their strategy for battle was to help one another out, be courageous and leave the outcome in the hands of The Lord. They went to battle for the glory of God, and for the sake of their families.

Today there is a war being waged against the people of God and families. There is a war against traditional marriage, and gender. There is a war against biblical values. How should the body of Christ respond to these vicious attacks? First of all, I am not suggesting that we go out and murder the enemies of God. I am suggesting that we be united in proclaiming to them the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of course we must lovingly state our position on any issues with Scripture, but have we forgotten the latter part of The Master's command of Matthew 5?

Dear ones, are we spending far too much time debating our differences on Facebook and Twitter instead of being about our Father's business of sharing the gospel and loving one another in Christ?Yes, differences exist within the family of God, but when differences become divisive, who wins, and who laughs? There is room and need for our exhorting one another; but not to the point of canceling out the witness of Christ in the process.

May I suggest that we make real efforts to love another in Christ. Pray for one another. Our marriages. Our children. Our churches. When we walk in that love, I believe our witness of Christ will be stronger and more powerful than when we try to do it alone.</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>Hi Ray (nice name!),
While both Putin and President Obama are leaders of very powerful nations whom The Lord has allowed to be on the earth at this particular time, I personally do not clearly see them as being these two kings. I certainly would not teach it that way.
I believe we must be extremely careful in "piecing together" current events to "fit" fulfillment of end times prophecy. Let's pray for Mr Putin and President Obama as Scripture instructs us to. For now brother Ray, serve The Lord and look up, your redemption draweth nigh! Lord willing, see you tomorrow!!</ns0:comment_content>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Now the title of this devotion is like stepping on a landmine. I mean, how in the world can a 60 year old grandfather know what it means to be a liberated woman? Well ladies, I could not agree with you more. But, what I am about to share with you this morning are not the words or opinions of a 60 year old man, but the words of The True and Living God (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 Thessalonians 2:13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Opinions are a dime a dozen, but Gods Word is not just some opinion; it is living and powerful and is His reality check on any given subject (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hebrews 4:12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). When we open the Bible we are being exposed to Spirit-filled truth that is meant to bring about necessary reproof, correction and instruction in how to live a righteous, God-pleasing life (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16-17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). God promises that those who seek His word with all of their heart will be blessed (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Psalm 119:2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Thus we have Gods personal promise to bless those who fear Him and walk in His ways (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Psalm 128:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I am sure all who are born again (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;John 3:3-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) would agree with what I have just said. But what makes it all happen is application of that truth (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James 1:21-25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Gods Word must be mixed with faith if we expect to experience the fruit He promises. Remember how the Israelites wandered in the wilderness instead of entering into the Promised Land because of their unbelief and failure to act upon Gods word (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hebrews 3:16-4:2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;So as we begin to look at the God-given roles for the wife and husband, each spouse must first go before The Lord and make that decision to obey whatever He says, whether you feel like it or not. Our feelings can so easily get in the way of Gods blessing in our lives. Strong feelings of resentment or bitterness can build walls between a couple. To hold on to them is a mortal blow to your relationship. As I said a few weeks ago, when we choose to hold on to bad feelings, it is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;talks about two being better than one, and how a threefold cord is not quickly broken. This is a beautiful picture of a husband and wife, knit to Christ and one another in the covenant of marriage. Each cord in the relationship is responsible to fulfill his/her specific role for the benefit of the spouse, but ultimately for the glory of God. So precious wives, ladies and sisters, when we go through these passages in our study, remember Who has given them to us and what His purposes are for sending them to us. Our Creator knows the kind of woman that a man needs; and likewise, our Creator knows the kind of man that a woman needs. Resist the devilish voice that says, Has God indeed said ...? (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Genesis 3:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) Gods wisdom for the married life is profoundly simple. Hear, heed, and obey, and leave the results to Him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Paul wrote his letter to the Colossians while he was imprisoned in Rome waiting for his trial before Caesar. He wrote this epistle to combat heretical teachings that had crept into the church, many of which persist in the church today. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this powerful epistle.

		<ns3:encoded>People are not saved by faith in faith. A modern cult of believism promotes a faith that has little to do with Jesus Christ. Saving faith involves the mind, the emotions, and the will. Only when we, by the power of the Holy Spirit, exercise our will and commit ourselves to Christ can the process be complete. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, verse four, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his teaching on the first eight verses.

		<ns3:encoded>Todays section of Scripture gives us a glimpse into the prayer life of Paul and Timothy. These Spirit-inspired passages provide us some wonderful things that we can be praying for one another. Whenever we pray for another person, we are making a divine deposit into their life. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins this study of verses nine through fourteen.

		<ns3:encoded>Christians have overcome the devil by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. Christians have been delivered from Satans domain. The key verbs are in the past tense, because it is a fact that your salvation has already been accomplished if you have confessed that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his study of verses nine through fourteen.

		<ns3:encoded>God is not honored by ignorance of Him. We are living in an age of spiritual deception and blurred biblical truth. Many are being deceived by the religious rhetoric that comes from world religions and pseudo-Christian cults who masquerade as followers of Jesus Christ. If one assembles what all of these religious groups say about Jesus, one gets an image of a dillusioned man, who is not God, and who has no power to save. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, verse fifteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola refutes this blaphemous image of Jesus Christ.

		<ns3:encoded>Religions say, Forgive your brother, feed the poor, and be a better person, then maybe you and God can talk. The Gospel says, Come to Me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Its not, Clean up, then come, but rather, Come when youre tired and come when youre weary. Jesus says, Come to Me now, and I will give you rest. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses fifteen through seventeen.

		<ns3:encoded>Too often in the modern Church, Christians only see God as a means to a better life. Such thinking treats God as if He exists for our benefit instead of us existing to please Him. Therefore, too many Christians merely add Jesus to their list of activities to enhance their life experiences. This diminishes Gods true power and glory. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale challenges us and encourages us with the first part of his message based on verses eighteen through twenty-three.

		<ns3:encoded>Before receiving Christ, we were alienated and enemies of King Jesus, but now, having been forgiven, we are blameless, cleansed, justified, and made holy. If Jesus is really supreme in your life, then you will understand that He has the power to free you from condemnation and guilt. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses eighteen through twenty-three.

		<ns3:encoded>1 Kings 13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as [it was] before.

There is a certain group of people within religious circles who are obsessed with signs, wonders and miracles. One needs to understand that Scripture places no such obsession upon such things. One cannot read the Bible and fail to see that when it comes to miracles and such, they are attributed to either God Almighty, or demonic powers. The purpose of this devotional is not to itemize those miracles for you.

Here is my question. When God performs a miracle in a person's life, does that always result in a change of heart? Not so. No nation saw more miracles than the nation of Israel. And yet God declared that for the most part, they were a stiff necked and rebellious people. In the chapter where our passage is found. A man of God pronounces a judgment against the altar of God, as well as a prophecy regarding the great reformer Josiah. When evil king Jeroboam commanded that the man of God be arrested, God caused his hand to wither up. In a show of amazing grace and mercy, Upon hearing the prayer made by the man of God for the King, God granted a miracle of healing. Incredible! An on the spot miracle of physical healing. No doubt Jeroboam is going to become a devout follower of Jehovah, right? Wrong. We will read a bit later in this chapter, after this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places. He returns to his idolatrous ways. Why? Because his heart was not changed. Miracles from God are given to "get our attention." But regeneration and faith are works of God that are given to those who hear and believe God's Word.

There is nothing wrong in praying for miracles, beloved. But like Martha in the gospel of Luke, only one thing is needful. And that is to sit at the feet of The Lord, and listen to His voice. Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. God changes our hearts through hearing and heeding His Word. Ironically, the greatest miracle on earth is a new creature in Christ.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Keep Walking</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Colossians 2:6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:

The Colossians church was being assaulted by many false doctrines concerning the Person of Jesus Christ and His gospel they we're being told that faith in Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross was not enough to take away their sin. Some insisted that they also needed to keep holy days. Others insisted that they blend the faith in Christ with philosophical ideas. Others insisted that they needed to begin living an ascetic kind of a lifestyle, forbidding them to even engage in lawful, marital sexual relationships.

Beloved, the devil is always attempting to undermine the true gospel of Jesus Christ with all kinds of legalistic or philosophical additions. Legalism will never accept the words of Jesus, "It is finished." My exhortation to you this morning is to read and meditate upon our devotional passage again. We received Christ by grace, through faith. Having begun in The Spirit, shall we now be made perfect by doing something else? Can we possibly do anything that could add to the finished work of Christ? Keep walking with Jesus today the same way you received Him as Lord. Totally needing His grace. Totally needing His power and strength. Totally trusting His perfect sacrifice for all of your sin. Remember that our salvation is the gift of God, Who has placed us in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. Having been brought to Christ by The Spirit of God, we are now called to be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor. Following Jesus means to walk by faith in Him. Following Jesus means to walk in His love.

We received Jesus knowing that there was no way that we could even attain salvation by our own good works. We continue to follow Jesus the same way we received Him as Lord, knowing that nothing we do after receiving Him can save us. Weary and discouraged child of God, look into the face of Christ this morning. Behold again His eternal grace and love for you. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Join Paul in his affirmation, I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. Keep walking, by keeping your eyes on Jesus.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Serving Christ with Fervent Praying</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Col 4.&lt;a&gt;12,13&lt;/a&gt;Epaphras, who isoneof you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and themthat arein Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

Epaphras is described by the apostle Paul as a servant of Christ. Please note that his fervent prayer life for others is a manifestation of serving Christ. But the kind of praying that is fervent. This recalls the passage in James that mentions the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man that avails much. Beloved, do we realize that when we pray for one another and with one another, that is one of the many ways that we get to serve Jesus Christ?

Many of God's people do not feel like they are serving Christ unless they are a preacher or worship leader, or some other visible type of ministry. Not so. In fact, it is the prayers of the saints that are the means that God uses to strengthen and direct His church. Fervent prayer is fueled by a zeal for The Lord and a love for others. Note that Epaphras' prayer was that the saints would stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. Pray that right now for your spouse. Your children. Your parents. You pastors. Your coworkers. God will sort out what that means as far as they are concerned. That is my prayer for each and every one of you who read this devotional today. Indeed, serving Christ with fervent praying is the kind of zeal that the church desperately needs.

Father, please birth within our souls a zeal for your glory and honor that is manifested by Spirit filled, fervent prayers for Your church today, in Jesus glorious Name.

		<ns3:encoded>Titus 2.14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

Please note, beloved, that prior to our call to good works, we find that Jesus gave Himself for us that we might be purified unto Him. Once again we see that the primary purpose of redemption is vertical, before it is horizontal. Being purified unto Jesus precedes doing good works in His Name. That is always the divine order. Vertical first, horizontal second. For if the order is reversed, then our good works become deeds of duty rather than expressions of worship unto God.

Jesus did not redeem us to be busy. He redeemed us for Himself. He redeemed us in order that we might be instruments in whom and through whom a lost and broken world might see Him manifested in our lives. Pure religion, as James writes, is only fruitful when our hearts and motives are first and foremost purified by The Lord Jesus. Good deeds in and of themselves can be wood, hay and stubble. Thus, the constant need today is to sit before The Lord and ask Him to touch our hearts and motives with a purity that does God works "unto Him." Because our flesh is so corrupt, this vertical pursuit and need of Christ is a moment by moment experience.

But here is the beauty of it all. That is how God designed it to be! The gospel is not a one time experience with no further need of revelation. The gospel is the good news that being redeemed is a life-long process of knowing Christ with the overflow of that fellowship resulting in good works being done in purity and for His glory and honor. These things Atticus was to preach and teach with all authority. Vertical first, then horizontal.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Trusting in God</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Psalm 2.12 Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.

There is a serious lack of trust in our world today. Every area of our lives, be it political, financial or even spiritual, is suffering from an absence of absolute trust. Because of the uncertainty of anything that has only temporal value, people are losing their health and any sense of peace. So who or what can one trust in these turbulent times? The Lord God, Maker of heaven and earth.

Consider these Scriptures this morning, beloved, that speak of trusting in God. These are His words and promises. Read them. Let them soak into your souls. They are medicine for the weary and worried mind.
Psalm 9.10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
Psalm 18.30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
Psalm 37.5 Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.

Now, you take it from here. Do a trust word search for yourself. Let God Himself speak to you through His Word. The reason why God repeats these references about trusting Him is because we are so prone to forget. Trust in The Lord with all of your heart today, beloved. No matter what, trust Him. Blessed are ALL they that put their trust in Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Revelation 22.20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 12.4-7 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.&lt;/strong&gt;

I have been in the body of Christ for enough years now to experience the many times that people have wrongly predicted the exact day when Jesus would return. I have also experienced over the years disorderly and unbiblical expressions of charisma. These demonstrations of extremism in The Name of Jesus have turned people off, both inside and outside of the church whenever the subject of the coming of Christ and the present day operation of the gifts of The Holy Spirit is brought up. Because of the odd behavior of those claiming to be Spirit-filled, or the downright false Thus saith The Lord predictions of the return of Christ, even those in the body of Christ tend to play it safe and avoid any and every discussion about these two very critical doctrines of Scripture.

Beloved, I am unashamed to tell you that Jesus Christ is coming again! Surely, I come quickly, Jesus said. The certainty of His coming will impact the way that we live and the way that we serve. There will be a sense of urgency and immanency. Belief in the doctrine of the coming of Christ will cause you to walk carefully, redeeming the time for the glory of God. It will affect every single area of your life. It will affect your priorities.

Do not be afraid to tell people that Jesus Christ is coming again. He said that He was!

Likewise, because of emotional, unbiblical expressions of the move of Gods Spirit, many saints shy away from any kind of discussion or expression of the gifts of The Spirit. My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, The Holy Spirit is alive and well in the body of Christ today. Do not allow the error of these religious extremists rob you of the biblical reality of the coming of Christ or the Person and operation of the gifts of The Holy Spirit in and through His church. Selah

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One of the mysteries in the New Testament is the mystery of the present day spiritual blindness of the nation of Israel (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 11:25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). While many Jewish people are coming to the saving knowledge of Yeshua as their Messiah (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 11:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), by and large the Jewish people as a whole are blinded to that fact (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Corinthians 4:3,4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). All of this, of course, is part of Gods amazing plan (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 11:29-36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The nation of Israel comes into view as we look into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Revelation 12 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;this morning. Some have sought to identify the woman portrayed in this chapter as either Mary or the church, but if you place the name Mary or the word church wherever the word woman is used, the pieces just do not fit. It seems very clear that John is speaking about the nation of Israel there. Also, if you look at the two dreams of Joseph in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Genesis 37:5-11 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;and compare them with what we read in the first few verses of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Revelation 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, the nation of Israel is once again a safe cross-reference. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;One of the important distinctions that needs to be made is that between the church and the nation of Israel. Paul exhorted the saints in Corinth to be very careful in how they handled partaking of things that were of questionable origin. His admonition to them was that they were to give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;1 Corinthians 10:32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Please note that The Holy Spirit made the distinction between an unsaved Jew or Gentile and the church, which was composed of both saved Jews and Gentiles (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Ephesians 2:11-3:6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Even in the eternal city, The Holy Spirit makes the distinction between the twelve tribes of the children of Israel and the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Revelation 21:12,14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;The present day remnant of Jewish believers are the natural branches (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 11:13-24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) that are a part of the mystery body of people otherwise known as the church (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Ephesians 5:32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The existence of the church does not mean the extinction of the nation of Israel. Through this nation our Messiah Jesus has come (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 1:3-4, 9:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), and by virtue of divine election through grace, many have come to the saving knowledge of The Lord Jesus Christ (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Romans 9:27-29, 11:1-7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). Our texts this morning remind us that God has neither forgotten nor forsaken His promise to the nation of Israel (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Jeremiah 33:23-26; Psalm 83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;As welook into The Masters Plan for marriage, we are going to comment on the passage that leads into the subject of marriage, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Ephesians 5:21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) Many people curl up into a proverbial ball when they hear the word submission (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;myself included!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The reason why we react this way is because the remaining corruption that is in our flesh does not want to let go of its independence. The voice of the flesh is always, We will not have this man to reign over us. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Luke 19:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) But unless the Lord reigns over us, our lives will be reduced to chaos and confusion, for where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James 3:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;So, as we once again look at Gods GPS (Gods Perfect Solution) for marriage, may God grant us the grace to submit to His truth. When we determine to change our attitudes and actions to align with Gods perfect word, God promises: ...I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Proverbs 1:23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;This submission to Gods Word must not be thought of as some kind of overnight magic that immediately removes years of sowing to the flesh, but it does set into motion those seeds of The Spirit that will in due time spring up and bring about true change for the better. What physical therapy is to our physical bodies, godly submission is to our souls. Initially there is that ache and pain that have built up over years of inactivity that are now being invaded by this strange phenomenon called discipline (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;ouch!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;). The Spirit of God reminds us that no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Hebrews 12:11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;As we look to The Master Builder (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Psalm 127:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), may we let patience have its perfect work (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;James 1:4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) as God does some heart and home repairs in our lives. God has included this subject of marriage in Scripture, knowing that not only married, but also single, widowed, or divorced people would be reading them. How wonderful it is to know that all of Gods Word is profitable (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;2 Timothy 3:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;), and it contains the DNA of life for those who hear and heed its message with all of our hearts. Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him with the whole heart. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Psalm 119:2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The perfect will of God for each and every one of His children is that we be grounded in His love, and settled in the faith. Our hope is in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Every single saint must fight the good fight of faith while weathering the storms of opposition and lifes disappointments. Moreover, to make our calling and election sure, we must abide in Christ. Please open your Bible to Colossians, chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses twenty-four through twenty-nine.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul wrote about a mystery that was once concealed, but has been revealed as part of the New Covenant that Christ established after His death and resurrection and after the Holy Spirit was poured out on all flesh on the day of Pentecost. The mystery was not that Gentiles would be saved, but that they could be fellow-heirs with Jews, having no middle wall of partition between them.  Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses twenty-four through twenty-nine.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul was a man that had a shepherds heart. He was driven by the love of Christ, as well as a God-given concern for the spiritual welfare of the saints in Colossae, Laodicea and for those who had never met him. Paul prayed that these believers would be knit together in love. Unfortunately, many, especially in Laodicea, had become lukewarm within a generation. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola tells us how to avoid becoming beguiled into apostasty as he begins his study of verses one through ten.

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Secular and worldly philosophies comprise the efforts of fallen men to determine, apart from the Scriptures, the ultimate causes in the earth and the universe. They seek to answer questions like, how did the universe come about? Why was I born? What is my purpose in life? The Holy Spirit calls these worldly philosophies vain deceit. Only the Bible has the correct answers to these important questions. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter two, verse five, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses one through ten.

		<ns3:encoded>The circumcision of Christ is the supernatural work of God made without human hands, and it is superior to physical circumcision. Judaizers tried to convince Gentile Christians that they also needed to be circumcised to be saved. In other words, as some erroneously teach today, Christs work is insufficient in and of itself to save you. The gospel that saves is not faith in Jesus plus any work or ritual. Salvation is all by grace, through faith in Jesus, period! Please open your Bibles to Colossians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale begins his study of verses eleven through fifteen.

		<ns3:encoded>When Jesus died on the cross, He blotted out our bill of debt that we owed because of our sins. That means that Christ not only paid our sin debt in full, He literally erased any record that our sin debt ever even existed!  What a great and merciful God we serve! Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses eleven through fifteen.

		<ns3:encoded>Do you want to know Gods will for your life? Today we will hear about three aspects of Gods will: His sovereign will, His moral will, and His specific will. Please open your Bible to Colossians Chapter three, verse one, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale shows us that the clearer you are about Gods sovereign and moral will, the easier it will be to discover Gods specific will for your life.

		<ns3:encoded>After Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead, he got a new perspective on life. In a very tangible way, he saw that his God was much bigger than anything in this world. Pastor Ben Hiwale used Lazarus example to emphasize our need to align ourselves with Gods sovereign and moral will, so that we can make good life choices. We will make good choices when we, like Lazarus, realize that it is Christ Who is our life. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben completes his study of verses one through four.

		<ns3:encoded>Walking in holiness is an ongoing process of repentance and sanctification. Holiness is choosing to put on the new man in Christ and leave the old life behind. If we are truly raised with Jesus Christ, then it will be evident in our lives, our attitudes, and our actions. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale begins his study of verses five through eleven.

		<ns3:encoded>Sin marred the image of God in man. However, Christ Jesus made it possible for that godly image to be renewed and restored when He died on the cross and rose again. This new image is renewed in the knowledge that God provides through His Word. Gods Holy Spirit, Who indwells believers, actively works to conform us into Christs image, because Jesus is the very image of the living God. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses five through eleven.

		<ns3:encoded>Having told his readers things that needed to be put off once they became new creatures in Christ (such as anger, covetousness, and fornication), Paul then admonished the people of Colosse to put on several things like mercy, humility, and agape love. Please open your Bible to Colossians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his teaching on verses twelve through seventeen.

		<ns3:encoded>Todays passage can be summarized in one sentence: The most valuable thing in life is knowing Christ and becoming like Him. As the imprisoned Apostle Paul knew all to well, knowing Christ and becoming like Him involves self sacrifice, personal pain, and rejection by many. Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter three, verse ten, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses one through eleven.

		<ns3:encoded>Our meditation this morning is a simple one. I am going to copy four sections of Scripture that mention faithful sayings of God, in hopes that as you read them and meditate upon them, the truth of God would embrace them prayerfully, that they might minister strength and encouragement to you in Christ.

1 Timothy 1.15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
1 Timothy 4.8,9 For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
2 Timothy 2.11-13 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
Titus 3.8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

May the assurance of salvation in Christ. The exhortation to godliness. The call to abide in Christ. And the manifestation of good works for God's glory bless your souls.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>For those who love Him</title>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Corinthians 2.9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

Would you note carefully who this promise is given to? For them that love God. Not for those who say they love God, but for those who truly love Him. Now we may love God differently or in different measures, but a true child of God is a man or woman who loves God and it shows.

Jesus said this about the woman in Luke 7, "she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." She loved much. Much forgiveness will be manifested in lavish love for Jesus.

And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. To whom do all things work together for good? To them that love God. They work together for good because they are lovers of God despite all of the heart-breaking, gut-wrenching things recorded at the end of that chapter. Those that love God know that He is good and that He will work out all things for our good and His glory.

"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him." Who will be the recipients of the crown of life? Those who endure testings of their faith in Jesus. And who are they who endure? Them that love Him. Those who love Jesus have an enduring love. A love for Him that enables them to endure in faith during the fiery trials of their faith.

"Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?" The kingdom to come is promised to whom? Them that love God. Beloved, the primary fruit of the new birth will be a love for The Lord Jesus Christ. We once were God's enemies, now we are His loving bride. Heaven-bound people are those who love The Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. To believe in Jesus Christ from the heart will turn you into a lover of Jesus. If any man love not The Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maranatha!

The question is not if you are Reformed, the question is are you reborn? The bible doesn't say, repent ye and become Baptist or Presbyterian or Lutheran. Repent and follow Jesus. Love Jesus, beloved. Love what He loves and who He loves. Love His Word. May the love of Christ and the love from Christ motivate all that you say and do. The best is yet to come for those that love Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Galatians 5.16 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

Have you ever noticed that when you decide to fast or go on some diet, the entire world seems to become one big hot fudge sundae? You find yourself trying to not think of eating, only to increase your hunger by thinking about what you are trying to avoid. Such is true in our walk with Jesus Christ. In our desire to walk in holiness, instead of focusing our eyes on The Lord, and what He tells us to seek after, we tend to think of all of the thingswe must avoid. Indeed, we must abstain from fleshly lusts that war after our souls, but you will never walk in holiness if all you do is focus on the flesh.

Walk in The Spirit. Put on the whole armor of God. Instead of dwelling on those fleshly lusts, choose those things that edify you and draw you closer to The Lord. Yes, we need to resist the devil and he will flee. But did you notice that the verse before that reads, draw near to God, and He will draw near to you! See the difference? Instead of dwelling on the negative, focus on the positive. Seek The Lord and His strength, seek His face forevermore.

If all you to is dwell on what you should not be doing, you will never learn to enjoy fellowship with the Lord, or experience the power of His grace. The Christian walk is not a defensive one, it is an offensive, intentional, deliberate pursuit of The Lord. It is preferring to be spiritually minded, rather than carnally minded. Yes, in our flesh dwells no good thing. No argument there. But to dwell on my flesh is not profitable, not virtuous and certainly not setting my affections on things above.

Refuse to be a follower of Jesus who only dwells on things after the flesh. Dwell on the things of The Spirit. Seek the face of The Lord in your prayer closet and throughout your day. When temptation comes, draw near to God and you automatically will resist the devil. Walk in the love of Christ today. Put His goodness and gentleness on display. Walk by faith, and not by sight. Desire what God says to desire, and that will help to keep you from eating that hot fudge Sundae.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The slippery slope of success</title>

		<ns3:encoded>2 Chronicles 11.17 For three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon. 11.23 and he gave them victual in abundance. 12.1,2 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him. And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord.

This is the record of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. At the start of his administration, he is walking after The Lord, as did his grandfather David and father Solomon. God's blessings are flowing. The kingdom is flourishing. But would you note, beloved, that there is a two year gap in our passages this morning. All we read is that during that period of time, Rehoboam is established and self sufficient (he strengthened himself), but he forsook The law of The Lord. Don't point your finger, dear ones. Do not even think, how could he? For you and I are prone to do the same thing without even knowing it.

It is very easy to experience the blessings of God and forget how much we really need Him. When God's grace allows us to have money in the bank, and things are going really well in life, it is so easy to cruise along in your Christian walk. After all, why would we need God when we have all of our needs met? Beware saints of having that kind of mentality in your heart. Oh, we would never say that we have no need of The Lord, but deep inside, there is that danger of forsaking The Lord with passion because His material blessings have removed the urgency of our real need for Him.

To awaken Rehoboam, God stirred up the king of Egypt, which is a type of the old life or the world. Reader, are you sensing a presence or longing for the world this morning that was not even in your spiritual radar in years gone by? Could it be that the blessings of God have given you a false sense of security? Thus saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

The slippery slope of success is always the result of forsaking God. What is the answer? Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The Lord is righteous. The Lord is righteous. And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves. That is another way of saying, return to your first love and love Him, The Giver of every good and perfect gift. Love The Lord and bless His Name, not blessings He gives you.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Woe? or Whoa!</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Zephaniah 3.1,2 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God.

The prophet Zephaniah is writing a word of judgment and woe to the people of God. The reason for the woe was because instead of following The Lord and walking in His ways, they were following the ways of the other nations and feeding their fleshly lusts. The result? Spiritual and moral filth, pollution and oppression. Oh what a rip off sin is, dear ones! What a testimony to our fallen nature that has this strange propensity towards that which is forbidden!

What four things were the cause of God pronouncing this woe upon His people.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She obeyed not the voice of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She received not correction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She trusted not in The Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She drew not near to God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Had these people done the opposite, they would have had a wonder walk with The Lord, instead of a woe walk. Such is true for writer and reader this morning. Joshua said this to the people of God as they were standing on the edge of The Promised Land, And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

Joshua said, as for me and my house, we will serve The Lord. To make such a decision to serve The Lord means that a person will choose to obey God, receive His correction, trust in The Lord, and draw near to God with all of your heart.

What is one clear purpose for Scripture? All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. It is written that we would purpose to obey God, be corrected by His Word, trust Him and draw near to Him everyday throughout the day. The good works that follow will be wonder and testimony of His grace. Woe or wonder? The promises and consequences are laid out in God's Word. The choice is yours.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Zech 11.11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord.

Nothing happens by chance in God's universe. Though the mystery of iniquity and the wheels of divine providence are not easy to understand, the bottom line is that God rules in the affairs of men. Zechariah is a prophet that writes of both the first and second coming of The Lord Jesus Christ. Our meditation verse tells us that in the midst of the judgments of God, those who waited upon Him, knew that what was happening was from The Lord.

As the world turns, things happen on our earth that confound the minds of men. Politicians are at a loss for answers. Economists are divided in assessing the world's financial condition. The medical field is dealing with more mysterious illness and viruses than ever before. The liberal church is calling good evil and evil good. The Pope is having prayer meetings with leaders of other religions. Who are they praying to? And yet, for those who wait upon The Lord and meditate upon His Word, we know that what is happening is according to the commandments of God.

In another prophecy regarding Assyria, the prophet Isaiah said, The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand: For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?. The bible predicts perilous times in the last days. Days like those of Noah and Sodom and Gommorah. Days of rank rebellion against the moral government of God. Days of sensual hedonism and hearts of men waxing cold because of sin and hardened hearts.

In the midst of it all, the child of God can find a peace and comfort in The Lord and from The Lord. The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth. Headline news becomes part of our prayers. Those who rebel against God are our harvest field. Lift your eyes up to heaven today, beloved. Preach the gospel whenever and wherever you can. God will keep those in perfect peace, whose minds are stayed on Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Who is your father?</title>

		<ns3:encoded>John 8.42-44 If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

Many people today claim that God is their father. That same claim was made when Jesus was on earth. How does one know that The Living God is their father? Jesus gives us the answer. It may not be the answer that we like, but it is the one and only answer. The person that loves The Father is the person that loves Jesus Christ. When you love someone, you will show that love for them by doing things that please them. You will speak to others about that person that you love. In other words, your love for a person cannot be hidden or silent. When a person is born of God, he or she will love Jesus Christ. The Jesus of Scripture. They will seek to please Him in all that they do. They will speak often of Him. Their love for Him will not and cannot be a "private thing." A city set on a hill cannot be hid. You can tell a tree by its fruit.

On the other hand, the person who claims to love The Father but is living after the lusts of the flesh and has no testimony of Christ in their life is a flat out fraud. The apostle John wrote, Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. To commit here means to practice or a habit of living. In other words, a person who has no real testimony of Jesus Christ living in them will be living after the lusts of the flesh, which means that their spiritual father is not The Almighty but the devil.

A person that has God for the Father will love Jesus and it will show. They cannot be hidden or silent about their love for Him. Sinless perfection is not the criteria for sonship, for that claim belongs to Jesus alone. Faith in Who Jesus is and what He has done to provide forgiveness of sin will produces a newness of life that is the proof of the Fatherhood of God. Who is your father?</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Faith in Christ: medicine for the troubled heart</title>

		<ns3:encoded>John 14.1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

Sounds to me like a troubled heart is a choice. That is what the words "let not" mean. Jesus had taught these 12 men for three years, Judas, the traitor has left them.Jesus is about to enter into His darkest moments on earth in preparation to be made sin for us. The disciples were told that they would be persecuted, hated and eventually martyred for their faith in Jesus. Knowing this, Jesus tells them to believe in Him and not be afraid. Beloved brothers and sisters in Jesus, believing in Jesus is heaven's medicine for our troubled hearts.

Speaking of the last days, Jesus said and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. When we see the very things happening in the world that Jesus said would happen prior to His Second Coming, He tells us to not be troubled. How can one not be troubled? Only by looking to Jesus and keeping our eyes on Him. Because He is Lord over all affairs of men on planet earth, we needn't be troubled.

Being frail and fractured people, like Martha, we get as easily troubled by the simple things of daily needs. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. How can one not be troubled when in the midst of hosting a dinner at our home, a bible study breaks out, and my assistant takes off her apron and decides to take a break and sit in on it? Only by looking to Jesus and keeping our eyes on Him. Because He is Lord over all affairs of the smallest details of our lives, we needn't be troubled.

The beautiful 46th Psalm reads, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; The Lord of hosts is with us;the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

A simple word for today, dear ones. Keep your eyes on Jesus. Troubles are inevitable until we go home. That is what Jesus is saying here inJohn 14.1-3. Faith in Jesus' care, love and presence is God's medicine for our troubled hearts.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Faith and Hope: Confident Expectation in the Goodness of God</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Hebrews 11.1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

The biblical meaning of faith and hope is not some passive resignation to my circumstances, but a confident expectation that God will do what He says He will do. We see in our passage this morning that faith and hope are twin pillars of the Christian life. In 1 Timothy 1, The Lord Jesus Christ Himself is called our hope, but inHebrews, Jesus is The Author and Finisher of our faith. So this faith and hope that I am speaking of this morning is a confident expectation that is rooted and grounded in the character of God Himself.

Peter writes that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is living proof that our faith and hope can be placed in God. For the child of God, by grace, through faith in Jesus Christ, we have been given the promise of an endless hope. The gospel is the message that, being justified by His grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

It is this confident expectation in the character and promise of God that sustained Abraham's faith when God told him to bring Isaac to the top of the mountain. Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. It was faith and hope in the promise of God that caused Abraham to believe that God would do what He said He would do.

Life is fragile, saints, isn't it? The winds of circumstances can change from one minute to the next. But God never changes. When we are walking in the light with Him, we can have a confident expectation that what He has promised, He is able to perform. Hope thou in God says the Scripture. Your faith in God is not in vain.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him  and said,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is the LORD God of Elijah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when he also had struck the water, it was divided and Elisha crossed over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Kings 2:14&lt;/em&gt;

Many people question the whereabouts of God as they experience trying moments in life. Because we do not always feel Gods presence in our lives we are prone to ask the Lord, Where are You? In times of distress other people may ask us, &lt;em&gt;Where is your God?&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 42:3) The unsaved world looks at the Church when things are rough and says, &lt;em&gt;Where is their God?&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 79:10)

The answer is that our God is in the heavens. However, Jesus also said that &lt;em&gt;where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.&lt;/em&gt; (Matt 18:20) The God of Elijah is omnipresent; He is everywhere. He is a very present help in time of trouble. The God of Elijah is inescapable (Psalm 139:7-10)!

Jesus promised His disciples that He would be with them always. He will never leave nor forsake any of His children. He is our comfort when we are in trouble, our strength in weakness, our peace amidst lifes storms.

The God of Elijah is not hard to find when your heart is His dwelling place. Is the God of Elijah &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; God?

		<ns3:encoded>Following Christ is not a hobby or a lifestyle supplement. Following Jesus requires complete commitment to the high calling that we have in Him. Our efforts do not save us, but, like an athlete training to win a race, it does take effort to mature and to deepen our relationship with Him. Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale begins to show us, not only how to run the race, but to finish well after the reading of verses twelve through twenty-one.[audio mp3="https://selahonradio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/03-03-2020-Selah-MP3-for-Audio-Podcasting.mp3"][/audio]

		<ns3:encoded>Paul persecuted followers of Christ, but he was able to put his violent past behind him, because Christ made him His own. This is the power of the Gospel. Give your life to Christ today, and, regardless of your past or what you are going through now, Jesus will make you His own if you put your trust in Him to save you! Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses twelve through twenty-one.

		<ns3:encoded>Christian joy is not dependent upon lifes circumstances. The only true source of joy in a Christians life is the awareness of Christs constant presence. We cant always rejoice in our circumstances, but we can always rejoice in the Lord. Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter four, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses one through nine.

		<ns3:encoded>Worry literally strangles a person: It chokes out their joy and can ruin their health. In todays passage, the Apostle Paul tells us that prayer is the medicine that will cure worry. Prayer is fellowshipping with God, and it presumes that God is near listening to you. So, whatever is bothering you, bring it to the Lord in prayer, and He will give you peace. Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter four, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses one through nine.

		<ns3:encoded>Contentment is not a buzz word in our society, but Biblically there is a connection between godliness and contentment. From a prison cell, the Apostle Paul in his closing comments addressed the need for our hearts to be focused above, on others, and on eternity, not on ourselves. The key to contentment is satisfaction in Christ! Please open your Bible to Philippians chapter four, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his teaching on verses ten through twenty-three.

		<ns3:encoded>Today we begin a study of Pauls epistle to the Galatians. When Paul wrote this epistle, the credibility of Pauls apostleship was under attack. The legalists and the ritualists of the day were also attacking the very Gospel of Gods grace. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this powerful epistle.

		<ns3:encoded>The foundation of all true preaching, teaching, and worship is the proclamation that Jesus was crucified for our deliverance according to Gods will. The Gospel gives grace to man and glory to God, because it by Gods grace, through faith in Christs perfect sacrifice, that a penitant sinner is instantly delivered from the power of darkness and is translated into the kingdom of Gods dear Son. To Him be glory forever and ever! Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his teaching on the first ten verses.

		<ns3:encoded>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a revelation message. It is not a message of human origin. It is not a message that can be understood by the natural man. Its origin and reception is via the revelation of God. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins this study of verses ten through twenty-four.

		<title>Taxes, Hypocrisy, and Living for God</title>

Mark 12:13,14  And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

 
Its the final week of Jesus earthly life, and the inevitable conflict with the religious hierarchy of His day is going to come to a head. We see in our study that Jesus is being confronted by the strange alliance of the Pharisees and the Herodians. That would be like Adolph Hitler and the President of Israel going out to dinner together. What brought these two rival groups together was their mutual hatred for Jesus Christ. The trap they sought to catch Jesus in was whether or not it was right to pay taxes to Ceasar. If Jesus said yes, the Jews would believe that He was siding with the enemy of Israel. If He said no, He would be arrested as an insurrectionist. How would Jesus reply? Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. And they marveled at Him. (Mark 12:17)

Jesus saw right through the religious hypocrisy and flattery of the Pharisees. He knew that they couldnt care less about whether or not they should pay taxes; they just wanted Him out of the picture, and this matter of paying taxes would put the proverbial nail in His coffin. Jesus answer about the image on the coin leveled both of these opposing parties.

Yes, God teaches us that human government is ordained by Him and is to be submitted to, with the only exception being when the government commands us to disobey God. But for the religious hypocrites, Jesus said that being made in the image of God means that we owe everything to God. Until a person is born again, Jesus Christ will be a threat to their self-rule. The message of the gospel of Jesus Christ is this: For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. (2 Corinthians 5:14-15)

Whose image do you live for, Caesars or Christs? Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Luke 21.34-36 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

The apostle Paul wrote in 1 Thessalonians 5, "Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ." The grace of God is not a message that teaches sinners to be careless. Quite the contrary. We are taught to be sober, vigilant and watchful.

Jesus says that our hearts must be guarded against the kind of living that is overweighed with worldly cares and worldly pleasures. The kind of living that is likened to being asleep or oblivious to the reality of His coming at any moment. It is so easy to get "caught up" in the world, isn't it? It is so easy to seek to deaden the reality of sorrow or the day to day demands of life with carnal pleasures or artificial means of security.

God tells us that we must be fully armored to stand against anything or anyone that would cause the focus of our lives to be drawn away from living for Christ and His kingdom, to living for myself and my kingdom. It is because we have not been appointed unto wrath that we are to live lives that set our affections on things above, not on things of the earth. Jesus said, follow Me, and you never think of the words "worldly", "covetous" or "selfish" when you think of Jesus, do you?

Jesus sought to please The Father in all that He said and did. God in His love lays these warnings out for us because He knows our propensity to waver and wander off course. We live in this world, but are not of this world. Revelation 19 teaches us that the great reward and celebration is in glory. There is no need to strive for " the good life" as it is defined by those who do not know Jesus Christ. Be content with such things as you have. Live a life of thanksgiving towards God. Seek first His kingdom. Treasure Jesus and His love for you. He is coming for those whose garments are unspotted with the world.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 9.24 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

We are living in an age of dry eyes and selfish crying. It is indicative of the self-love of the last days. Hearts of men are both hardened by sin and waxed cold. But there are those souls who are found weeping because they have been touched by The Lord Jesus, or because they are desperate and in need of His tender touch. The father of this possessed child in our devotional passage is heard crying out to Jesus for His son's healing. The woman of ill repute is mentioned in Luke 7, and "she stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment." Having been touched by The Lord Jesus, she unashamedly worships Him with tears.

The apostle Paul's life and ministry was filled with tears of sacrifice, joy and sorrow.He served the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, "which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews".

Aware of the danger of false teachers, Paul exhorts the church to watch, and remember, "that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears." When it was necessary to rebuke the Corinthian church, we read "for out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you." Timothy was a man of God who served The Lord with much emotion. When Paul was awaiting his visit, he wrote that he was greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.

Weeping and serving The Lord are inseparable. The Master Jesus wept at Lazarus' grave. He wept in prayer. "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared." But when all is said and done, beloved, when the tears of worship, the tears of sadness, the tears of pain and tears of sorrow are done, God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Godly, holy weeping in the kingdom of God is not a sign of weakness, it is the evidence of the life of God within.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Luke 23.43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.

Paradise is a word that is used to describe a beautiful place on earth, or some incredible experience. It is mans word to identify something that is in their estimation, "the ultimate." For the child of God, paradise is a description of their future home. They do not believe the "sales pitch" that this condo or this location or this purchase will be like paradise. No way. Not even close. I cannot even begin to imagine what this penitent thief was feeling or thinking when The Lord Jesus said to him, today, you will be with me in paradise. But I suspect that the excruciating pain in his body and guilt of the crime he committed disapted a bit. What would you think or feel if Jesus said to you, right now, whoever you are and whatever you are going through, "Today, you will be with Me in paradise!." I think you would probably see your present dilemma or situation in an entirely different light. So would I.

If paradise awaits you, you no longer need to "find it" here on earth for the simple reason that the paradise of God cannot be found or bought on earth. How incredible is paradise? The apostle Paul was caught up to paradise where heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. As glorious as the description of Heaven is in Scripture, Paul adds that there were things that he heard, and presumably saw, that he could not even begin to describe. The Oooohs and Aaaahs on planet earth are short lived. Earthly pleasures only last so long. They cannot and do not endure forever. They were not created for that purpose. At best, they are gifts from God that remind us that earth is not our home, and the best is yet to come.

Paradise is home sweet home, beloved. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. It is home to over omers. And who are over omers? For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? Dear ones, one day, each of us in Christ will hear hi say to us, Today, you will be with Me in paradise. May that encourage and comfort you this day.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Haggai 1.3 Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.

God raised up the prophet Haggai to awaken His people out of spiritual slumber and selfcenteredness. Here is the long and short of it. The people had been wonderfully delivered out of captivity by Jehovah, but when they settled in, instead of making the house of God their numberone priority, they began building and remodeling their own homes, sparing no expense in the process. The result? Let God speak for Himself. "Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough;ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes." Emptiness. Rather than a sense of satisfaction and comfort, discontent.

That is why Jesus tells us to seek first His kingdom and righteousness. First doesn't means that He is your number one God, followed by God number two, etc. It means that The Lord Jesus Christ, His kingdom and His will must be what our lives revolve around. His agenda is now mine. His will is now mine. My fulfillment in life is wrapped up in fulfilling His will and doing those things that are pleasing in His sight. Selfishness is never godliness. When a person is living in sin, they are only thinking about themselves and not the will or things of the kingdom of God.

This morning beloved, consider your ways. Take spiritual inventory. God is watching. Consider your ways by looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. He didn't die for us to enrich ourselves or to build heaven on earth. He dies for us in order that whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. Lordship living, not selfishness, is the only life that satisfies, and that is what we were redeemed for, beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Cure for Sin</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Numbers 21.4-9 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

This incredible incident in the wanderings of the people of God is a type of the redemption that is offered to man through faith in the gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ. But it is also contains some practical elements that relate to our daily lives as well. Please note that the people were discouraged because of the way. Well, Who was leading them? The Lord was leading them by the cloud during the day, and by the pillar of fire at night. Have you ever been discouraged because of the way things are going in your life? Read on. They accused God of bringing the into the wilderness to die. They despised the daily manna that He provided them. What about you reader? Are you angry at the ways of God? Do you loathe His daily provision for you?

Note that God does not take such criticism of Him kindly. He sends these poisonous, fiery serpents among them. Many are bitten and killed. Murmuring and complaining will kill you and me, beloved. Murmuring and complaining is like a serpents venom that gets into the bloodstream of your soul. It effects your entire perspective in life. It causes you to despise not only the provision of God, but the God of your provision as well. But God is both good and gracious. Does He wipe them out? No, He sends them the cure for sin. A serpent on a pole. When bitten (not if), if a man or woman looked at that serpent with faith in God's provision, they would not die.

Couple of things here. They asked God to take away the serpents. He didn't. Until we get to heaven, we are going to have to deal with sin in the world and sin in our lives. We are sinners. We do sin. We need forgiveness. The only cure for sin is Jesus Christ's perfect sacrifice, once and for all, and every day, all day. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. Life is short. Death is sure. Sin the cause. Christ the cure.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Samuel 2.30 For them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

These words were spoken by the man of God to the priest Eli regarding the unholy behavior of his sons, Hopni and Phineas, who also were priests. The word of God said of these two men that the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not The Lord. Their ungodly, irreverent lifestyles were evidence of this fact. Here are men that hold a sacred office, but do not possess a sacred heart. They are not really followers of God.

How does one honor The Lord? We know that honoring The Lord is not a matter or saying all the right words. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. The Pharisees were guilty of this. They twisted Scripture to accommodate their own doctrines that gave birth to behavior that was contrary to God's Word.

What, shall we sin (live in sin) that grace may abound? God forbid, says The Spirit of God. The choir of heaven sings, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. God receives glory and honor when our hearts are aligned with the things that bring Him pleasure, beloved. Thus pleasing God and honoring Him are one and the same thing.

The Psalmist declared, Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord,that delighteth greatly in his commandments. Honoring God is a matter of the heart, and where the heart is, the mind and feet will follow. We honor The Lord by walking in humble submission before Him, for the Proverbs say, before honour is humility.

We honor Jesus Christ by abiding in Him, and doing those things that are pleasing in His sight. So before you speak or act today, ask yourself, is this going to honor The Lord? Will this magnify Him? Will I regret that I said that or did this? Walk close with The Lord today. Refuse to "wing it". Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with thy God. That is how we honor Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>John 6.44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

Salvation is of The Lord. Fallen man is incapable of coming to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ apart from The Father's divine drawing. This is a very sobering and humbling teaching of Jesus. It is a statement of our fallen condition, being dead in trespasses and sins. Gods grace is necessary in order to produce faith because sinners are spiritually unable to trust in Christ on their own accord. Jesus Himself acknowledged that all who come to Him are drawn by The Father. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to Me, I shall I no wise cast out.

How does The Father draw His children to Christ? Jesus Himself said, And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This of course speaks of His crucifixion. Amazing! Man's conversion is a total work of God's grace. This removes boasting on our part. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Grace is God's Riches At Christ's Expense. Dear reader, do you understand this great mystery of salvation? Can you see the miracle that God has done in you and through you?

This divine mystery compels us to pray and preach the gospel to the lost, because those are the means that God uses to draw sinners to Christ. May the grace of God that has saved you grant you the strength and comfort to abide in Jesus today. The question mark of salvation has been replaced by the exclamation point of faith in the death, burial and resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Zech 4.6,7 - This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

Zerubbabel was a civil official that was responsible for the construction of the new temple. The task before him was daunting, signified by the phrase, "Ogreat mountain". But God does not assign a task to His people without granting us the power of His Spirit to fulfill it. Those obstacles that stood in the way of the building of the temple would be removed, not by Zerubabbel's strategy or intelligence or human strength, but by The Spirit of God. The same holds true for you and me today, beloved. Life and the challenges of life can be daunting. They at times seem like Mount Everest. We crumble under the pressure of the tasks. We realize that human strength and human wisdom is not going to cut it. Be of good cheer beloved. God has equipped you with all that you will need to fulfill your responsibilities today.

Before The Lord Jesus ascended up to heaven, the apostles were concerned about how they would accomplish the great task of reaching the lost with the gospel. The answer? "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."

Blessed be The Name of The Lord! He has given to us His Spirit to do His work. The Holy Spirit is like oil in the lamp stands of the vision of Zechariah. He fills us up in order that He might be poured out through us.

Thus, as we start our day today and look over the tasks on our Daytimer orsmartphones, we can have the assurance that God will provide the wisdom and strength of His Spirit to help us to carry out these tasks.
Place those mountain like tasks or appointments before The Lord today, beloved. Believe that God will lead you by His Spirit as you call upon His Name. "But if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."

Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. So too is walking in the power and wisdom of The Holy Spirit. Let your confidence today be this: Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The material in quotes in today's blog is actually taken from the notes of The Reformation Heritage Bible on Zechariah 7 that I was reading this morning. I couldn't say it any better.

"Perfunctory religious rituals without a genuine heart for the Lord never pleases Him. God is never satisfied with religion without devotion. These fasts commemorating the captivity were of their own devising and were conducted without any thought toward God. Whatever their motive, it was not a service being rendered to God. It is all too easy to be taken up with the liturgical calendar or even routine services and assume that the mere exercise or observance pleases the Lord. Those that worship God must do so with genuine hearts (in spirit and truth), and God looks through the rituals right to the heart."

This is exactly what Jesus meant when He told the church at Ephesus that they had left their first love. Oh, they were right on in many areas of theology and practice, but the problem was that they had become a religious machine. They were no longer being driven by the love of Jesus or a love for Jesus. It was business as usual. Every single Christian and every local church must realize how easy it is to "do the work of The Lord" without being motivated by a love for The Lord of the work. We can fast, pray, give and sing with no real regard for Christ. It happens all the time.

May God grant to writer and reader alike a genuine wake up call regarding the motives of why we do what we do. 1 Cor 13 tells us that we can do some outstanding religious things without an ounce of love. God help us and deliver us from such self centered expressions of "faith." Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Webster tells us that the word &lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt; means to be at liberty, no longer enslaved. What a beautiful picture of the Christian life! Jesus Christ indeed makes His people free (&lt;b&gt;John 8:32-36&lt;/b&gt;). Three times in &lt;b&gt;Romans 5 &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;b&gt;verses 15,16,18&lt;/b&gt;) we are told that eternal life is a free gift that is given by Jesus Christ to those who trust in Him by calling upon His name (&lt;b&gt;Romans 10:11-13&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;As glorious as being forgiven is, it is equally glorious to know that the indwelling Spirit of God enables us to walk in newness of life (&lt;b&gt;Romans 6:4; 8:10,11&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Before we knew Jesus, sin was our master; it ruled our lives and it most certainly ruined them.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;But now, by the grace of God, we are in Christ Jesus, and we are constantly being delivered from sins destructive power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Yes, there is a constant battle with temptation (&lt;b&gt;1 Corinthians 10:13&lt;/b&gt;) and worldly lusts (&lt;b&gt;Titus 2:12&lt;/b&gt;), but our former master is now destroyed (&lt;b&gt;Romans 6:6&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;That word means unemployed, so dont give him a job!&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Thanks be to God for this gift of victory (&lt;b&gt;1 John 5:4&lt;/b&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>When Paul went to visit the Apostles concerning the push by many Jews to require Gentile Christians to also follow the Mosaic Law, Paul did not give into the Judeaizers for a moment so that the truth of the Gospel might remain uncompromised. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale continues his study of verses one through ten, plus the first eleven verses of Acts chapter fifteen, in his message entitled A Hill to Die On.

		<ns3:encoded>Jesus plus nothing equals everything. Jesus plus anything else is slavery, and it will kill you. The Gospel is the perfect infusion of Law and Grace, and it is the same Gospel for both Jews and Gentiles. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale begins his study of verses one through ten plus the first eleven verses of Acts chapter fifteen.

		<ns3:encoded>The proof of Gods love for us is the sacrifice of Jesus on Calvary whereby He willingly paid the just penalty for our sins. In so doing, He delivered all that have faith in His complete and all-sufficient work of salvation from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of God. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses eleven through twenty-one.

		<ns3:encoded>No one can be justified by keeping the Law of God. Said another way, Gods Law is only a diagnostic tool that reveals our sinfulness and our need of a Savior. Gods grace is the only thing that saves us. Through grace, God changes our hearts, and it reveals that salvation only comes through faith in Christs redemptive work on the cross. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter two, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses one through ten in his message entitled A Hill to Die On.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul essentially described himself as a dead man walking. He declared that he was crucified with Christ. He meant that, after being born again, it was no longer his old self that lived, but, as a new creature in Christ, it was now Jesus that lived in and through him to the glory of God. Have you been born again? If not, todays message will tell you how you can be. Please open your Bible to Galatians, chapter two, verse seventeen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses eleven through twenty-one.

		<ns3:encoded>The Gospel is the way that we enter the kingdom of God. However, in todays passage, the Apostle Paul will show us that the Gospel is much more than that: We are not only saved by the Gospel, but it is also the Gospel that enables us to grow spiritually. That is, we are saved and sanctified by faith, not by our works. One must believe that only God can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale begins his study of verses one through nine.

		<ns3:encoded>Paul wanted the Galatians to understand that they were saved by what they believed and not by the works that they did. God wants us to believe in Him more. When we believe in Him more, and submit to His will, it will, by necessity, change what we do. But if we focus on our works, then we miss the liberation that the Gospel of faith provides. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ben Hiwale completes his study of verses one through nine.

		<ns3:encoded>When we carefully consider the finished work of Christ on the cross, it should leave us speechless. We, who are sinful, full of pride, and condemned by the Law, can be, through Jesus Christ, ransomed, redeemed, righteous, and justified. The cross of Christ destroys the curse that we are under because of sin, and it frees us from religion, works, and worry. Jesus paid it all! Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study after the reading of verses ten through eighteen.

		<ns3:encoded>A covenant, or agreement, between men, after it is ratified, cannot be annulled or altered without the consent of both parties. The covenant God made with Abraham was based on faith, not works. So when the law was added 430 years later, it didnt annul the covenant that stated that the faith of Abraham would be accounted for righteousness. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses ten through eighteen.

		<ns3:encoded>We should never write a person off as someone who will never come to the saving knowledge of Jesus, because he or she presently is vocally opposed to the Gospel. Paul was once an archenemy of the Gospel, but he was saved and converted by Gods grace to proclaim very Gospel and Person that he had set out to destroy. Please open your Bible to Galatians chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his study of verses ten through twenty-four.
