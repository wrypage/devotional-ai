		<ns3:encoded>Our society is stuck on stars - rock stars, movie stars. Some people even 'follow the stars' in the heavens to supposedly determine their futures (via horoscopes). How true God's word is when it writes about people worshiping and serving the creature more than, or rather than, the Creator. The stars in the heavens are the work of God's fingers. He even numbers each and every one of them and calls them by name.

On the human level, history has had a parade of stars or heroes, some no doubt more worthy of honor and acclaim than others. However, there is one Star that shines brighter than them all, and that is the Bright and Morning Star, Jesus Christ. Other lights come and go; however, His light is necessary for life.

To follow Jesus is to walk in His light, enjoying wonderful fellowship and cleansing from sin. So let's set our 'telescopes' once again upon Jesus Christ. While there's nothing wrong with a scientific study of stellar constellations, may we even more diligently seek Him who made them all! May we remember the Star whose light delivered us out of darkness and death.

In fresh surrender to Jesus, may our lives reflect His light and grace and bring Him the glory due His name.  Come and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The God who created the universe is glorious, and His creation provides evidence of His glory. Like God, His creation is big, beautiful, and He gave mankind the ability to see it, to appreciate its wonder, and to study its mysteries. Perhaps the greatest mystery is Gods unfailing love for that which He has created. Please open your Bible to Psalm nineteen, and follow along as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Jesus is the Cornerstone of the New Covenant by which a person can truly be saved from their sins, because He was the only Perfect Sacrifice that could satisfy Gods justice. If you have not done so already, look unto Him today and be saved, because there is no other way!

		<ns3:encoded>[et_pb_section][et_pb_row][et_pb_column type="4_4"][et_pb_text]It was unbelief, not giants, that prevented Israel from entering the Promised Land when Moses first brought them there. Todays passage contains a warning not to repeat that mistake, which is a symtpom of a heart that is hard towards God. Unbelief will always leave you restless, barren, and filled with despair. Faith in Jesus will help you to overcome the giants that you may be facing in your life today. Only He can give you rest for your soul. Please open your Bible to Psalm ninety-five, verse eight, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his discussion of that chapter.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]</ns3:encoded>

		<ns0:meta_value>It was unbelief, not giants, that prevented Israel from entering the Promised Land when Moses first brought them there. Todays passage contains a warning not to repeat that mistake, which is a symtpom of a heart that is hard towards God. Unbelief will always leave you restless, barren, and filled with despair. Faith in Jesus will help you to overcome the giants that you may be facing in your life today. Only He can give you rest for your soul. Please open your Bible to Psalm ninety-five, verse eight, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his discussion of that chapter.</ns0:meta_value>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;In todays passage, we finally see justice served to the deceivers. The False Prophet and the Beast are finally thrown into the lake of fire. Those who deceived the people that God has created will be judged on that day. Vengeance is the Lords. Please open your Bible to Revelation chapter nineteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses seventeen through twenty-one.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Jesus designed His Church to be prayer driven, not program driven. For the Church to effectively stand, serve, and evangelize, Christians must pray with and for one another. Prayer is a gift from God that creates a spiritual union that binds us together in our fellowship with Jesus Christ and with one another. Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola uses verses thirteen through eighteen of James chapter five to show us how important it is for us to pray, especially for one another.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;An exhortation is an address or other form of communication that emphatically urges someone to do something. While an exhortation can be used as a warning or a rebuke, it can also be a word of comfort or encouragment. After the reading of verses twenty-four and twenty-five of Hebrews chapter ten, Pastor Ray Viola will discuss this passage, and several other passages of Scripture, to provide specific examples of what the Bible means when it directs us to exhort one another.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;An exhortation is an address or other form of communication that emphatically urges someone to do something. While an exhortation can be used as a warning or a rebuke, it can also be a word of comfort or encouragment. After the reading of verses twenty-four and twenty-five of Hebrews chapter ten, Pastor Ray Viola will discuss this passage, and several other passages of Scripture, to provide specific examples of what the Bible means when it directs us to exhort one another.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Jesus designed His Church to be prayer driven, not program driven. For the Church to effectively stand, serve, and evangelize, Christians must pray with and for one another. Prayer is a gift from God that creates a spiritual union that binds us together in our fellowship with Jesus Christ and with one another. Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola uses verses thirteen through eighteen of James chapter five to show us how important it is for us to pray, especially for one another.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;What Christmas music do you listen to? Based on popular secular music, most people seem to think that Christmas is all about parties, snow, Rudolph, and Santa. The problem is that none of most popular songs have anything to do with the biblical reason for why Jesus Christ was born. To learn about the real significance of Christmas, please open your Bible to First John chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins the second message of our Advent Series entitled Why the Incarnation.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;What Christmas music do you listen to? Based on popular secular music, most people seem to think that Christmas is all about parties, snow, Rudolph, and Santa. The problem is that none of most popular songs have anything to do with the biblical reason for why Jesus Christ was born. To learn about the real significance of Christmas, please open your Bible to First John chapter one, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins the second message of our Advent Series entitled Why the Incarnation.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;The purpose of every church and every child of God is to worship, pray, serve, and live for the glory of Jesus Christ. Todays passage is a divine revelation and recognition of the slain Lamb Jesus Christ, Who takes away the sins of the world. Anyone that truly sees the slain Lamb cannot help but worship Him! Please open your Bible to Revelation chapter five, verse five, and follow along with Pastor Ray Viola as he begins his final message in his Advent series entitled Why the Incarnation.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;After more than a thousand years of prophets speaking to Israel of a coming Messiah and several hundred more years of prophetic silence, Jesus was born in Bethelem, as the prophets foretold. He went on to preach, prophesy, and die on a cross. After rising from the dead, He ascended into heaven, promising to return. Will you be ready? Please listen as Pastor Ray Viola unpacks several scriptures related to Jesus words taken from the last chapter of the New Testament, Behold, I come quickly.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Forty days after His resurrection, Jesus took His disciples just outside of Bethany where He ascended into heaven before their very eyes. They were now witnesses. After Jesus ascended, an angel asked them a question, Why do you stand gazing up into heaven? That is a relavant question for us today. Who or what are we looking for or to? Insights? Clarity? Exit? Please open your Bible to Acts chapter one, and listen as Ben Hiwale begins his study of verses nine through eleven.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Three words capture benefits of the redemption through Jesus Christ: repentance, refreshment, and restitution. The atoning work of Jesus opened the door of repentance to all. That redemption is the first fruit of the times of refreshing that comes from the Lords presence. It is also the guarantee that there will be a final restitution of all things that were spoken by the mouth of Gods holy prophets. Please open your Bible to Acts chapter three, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses seventeen through twenty-six.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage shows divine providence in operation. God is absolutely sovereign. He alone is God, and He providentially moves in the lives of people in different ways. In todays example, God used an angel to tell Philip that he should leave the revival in Samaria and go down to the desert area of Gaza. Philip did not question his instructions, nor did he ask, Why? He simply obeyed, and Gods purpose soon became clear. Please open your Bible to Acts chapter eight, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses twenty-six through forty&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>He Who Began a Good Work in You</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Other than verses 13 and 19 in Philippians 4, perhaps one of the most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;often quoted passage from this epistle is: Being confident of this very thing,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;that He Who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Jesus Christ. (Philippians 1:6) What a precious promise from God! What a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;powerful statement of reality! He Who has begun a good work in you, WILL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;complete it! He cannot fail to do so.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;That incredible promise of our security in Christ Jesus is put this way in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;what has come to be known as the golden chain of redemption. For whom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;He did foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom He&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;predestinated, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;and whom He justified, these He also glorified. Romans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="color: #222222"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;8:29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;,30) The heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;can barely grasp the wonder and depth of these amazing redemption passages.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;If you have repented of your sins and trusted in Christ alone for your&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;salvation, but feel like youre floundering a bit this morning, be encouraged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Jesus said that He gives to His sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;and nobody can snatch us out of His hand. (John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="aBn" style="color: #222222"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;10:28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;). That is security, my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;friend! Because of their faith in Jesus Christ, Paul identifies the recipients of this epistle as saints, for whom he was thankful. Because this earth is not heaven, Paul prays for God to bless them with a deeper love, knowledge and discernment as they walk with Jesus. You see, not only do we need the grace of God to save us, but we likewise need His matchless grace to enable us to be good witnesses for Him in this fallen world, bearing good fruit for the glory of God.&lt;/span&gt;

Having begun in The Spirit, we are not made perfect by our own doings and efforts. Salvation is of The Lord, from start to finish. He Who started the work in you will be faithful to complete it!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>What&amp;#039;s Missing?</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Jesus Christ was under no delusions in His understanding of the world system. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (John 3:19).  The world cannot hate you; but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.  (John 7:7) The apostle John wrote, And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. (1 John 5:19) Because the very nature of this world is contrary to the will and purposes of God, James wrote to the church these words of warning: Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.(James 4:4)
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;What is missing in the world that causes it be to identified in these graphic terms? The Lord Jesus Christ dwelling in the hearts of mankind. When Jesus comes to dwell in the life of a person, he or she will become what Jesus calls the salt of the earth (Matthew 5:13). Salt in the days of the Bible was used to preserve food to keep it from rotting. It was used as medicine to curb infection. It was even used at times as a means of paying Roman soldiers. Salt was a very important commodity in those days. Because you and I have access to salt so easily, the words of Jesus may not have the same impact upon us that it did upon His listeners who heard Him speak those words at that time. The world that we live in is just as rotten as was the world in Jesus days, or perhaps even to a greater degree now with the constant barrage of moral filth via the internet and other forms of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;But God so loves the people of this world that He sent His Son Jesus to die for their sin (John 3:16-18), and He sprinkles His bride, the Church, into their lives to make an&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;impact for Him. Impact? Indeed! When you add salt to your food, it enhances its flavor. When people come into contact with a salty Christian, they may indeed persecute us and say all kinds of nasty stuff (Matthew 5:10-12), but when they see us doing the things that God tells us to, there will be those who will glorify our heavenly Father (Matthew 5:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;Loving Jesus supremely is the key to being a salty Christian (Matthew 22:36,37). &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Setting The Lord Jesus Christ apart in our hearts (1 Peter 3:15) is a decision that every saint must make daily if he or she purposes to be the salt of the earth. What is missing in this fallen world system? Salt. Beloved, wherever God in His divine providence &lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sprinkles you today, it is so that you might bring Him glory in such a way that others may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things (Titus 2:10), and be drawn unto Him.&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Fullness Of God For The Glory Of God</title>

This Spirit inspired prayer of Paul in Ephesians 3:14-21 is breathtaking. There is no way that I could even scratch the surface of the weightiness and vastness of what is being taught here. Human language falls so far short of this revelation of God towards us.
     
Two things jump out at me in this prayer. They are the two phrases, 'the fullness of God' and 'the glory of God.' The fullness of God is specifically mentioned in verse 19. The glory of God is most certainly implied in verse 21. Think about those two phrases for a moment. Now ponder in your heart what those two phrases mean. Now ask yourself what kind of an impact do those two phrases have in the molding of your life. How do those two phrases change your perspective in life? How do those two phrases affect the decisions that you make in life? 
    
What could possibly be more satisfying in life here on earth than being filled with the fullness of God? What purpose in life could be more glorious than living for the glory of God? As we connect these two phrases into one closing thought, we realize that the divine purpose for us being filled with the fullness of God is that we might live for the glory of God. 'And of His' (The Lord Jesus) 'fullness have we received, and grace for grace.' (John 1:16) 'Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto Thy Name give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake.' (Psalm 115:1). </ns3:encoded>

		<title>Fasting And Marriage</title>

The Apostle Paul wrote about the value that fasting has in connection with marriage in 1 Cor 7:5. 

Question:  When was the last time that you fasted for your marriage?  
Another question:  Are any of our marriages so perfect that we can toss aside the Holy Spirits admonition in the verse just quoted?

As we look at the topic of fasting this morning, it dawned on me more and more how relevant this topic is to marriage, family, and home life.  Now, do not get the idea that the primary reason to fast is so God may reveal to you your spouses faults (which may or may not happen).  The primary reason for fasting is to humble and chasten your soul before the Lord.  Fasting is a way to shut down our bodily appetites in favor of seeking spiritual refreshment and intimacy with Jesus.  

Face it, we all need the wisdom, strength, and help from the Lord in our homes.  Even if Gods grace has blessed our marriage and family, there is always room for improvement.  So, as we examine the Biblical benefits of fasting, lets seek to apply this secret weapon of God to our home and our church family.  The rewards will be tremendous.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Set Your Eyes Upon Jesus</title>

As I wrote this, its 10:30 a.m. in the Indian village of Kumbhelphal, and as I am touring the town, the songs of worship ring loud and clear through the firewood-scented air on this bright, sunny morning.  The music means that its time for service to begin.  (What?  No bulletin?)  Believers here have no musical instruments, and sit on woolen rugs that cover a cow dung hardened floor. 

But the Lord Jesus is in this place, and over 100 people are gathered together to worship Him and hear Gods word taught.  As Im looking around Im having my own Bible study of sorts via observation.  There is no nursery or childrens church, but nobody complains.  Cows are mooing, sheep are making noises, chickens and roosters are running about freely; yet every eye (except mine!) is looking earnestly upon the preacher.  Why arent they distracted?  Or rather, why are we so distracted in our services?  What is a church service supposed to be like?  Imagine the Sermon on the Mount.  Think of Gods hand forming the landscape and painting the sky, making the background for His people to gather together for worship, prayer, and instruction.  

Instantly, the Lord provides a refreshing wind, a welcome breeze to bring a cooling from the heat of the Indian day.  As I sat and wondered about it all, I pondered the differences in our cultures and how those effect our attitudes and ideas about what a church service is supposed to be like.  I also realized, in spite of the many and often obvious differences between American and Indian cultures, we, as believers, have far more important things in common.  What do we have in common?  We all believe in the same gospel and have the same wonderful Lord Jesus, the same amazing grace, the same loving heavenly Father, and the same Holy Spirit.

The invitation is given to come to Jesus, and many come.  Heaven rejoices!  

When we set our eyes upon Jesus, then the would-be distractions going on around us will seem nearly non-existent.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>The Lord reigns! What comfort these words bring in the midst of the chaos and degradation that surrounds us. For we know that, in the fulness of time, Jesus will fully assert His authority over the affairs of men, and the whole world will know peace, and the will of God will finally be done on earth as it is in heaven. Please open your Bible to Psalm ninety-three, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola discusses this theocratic psalm.

But Barnabas believed his testimony and trusted him. He brought Saul to the leaders of the Church. Only in eternity will we know how vital it was for Barnabas to befriend this questionable man, whom God used to spread the Gospel to the whole world. Perhaps you can encourage someone today. Please open your Bible to Acts chapter nine, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of verses nineteen through thirty-one.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage concerns Peter preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a Roman centurion and his kinsman. Some call this account Gentile Pentecost, because, for the first time, God poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit on a group of Gentiles. Most of us listening to this message are spiritual offspring of what the Lord did on that day. Please open your Bible to Acts chapter ten, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of verses one through thirty-three.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;The Lord told Paul that he would go to Rome, because He had work for him to do there. Though in the center of Gods will, Pauls journey to Rome was anything but smooth sailing. Despite the dangers that they faced on this voyage, Paul knew that God was in control of everything, and he made it a point to pass that along to everyone else on board. Please open your Bible to Acts twenty-seven, and follow along as Pastor Ray Viola begins his discussion of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<title>Being a &amp;quot;Put On&amp;quot;</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=859</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;In the world, a person who is a put on is a phony. To be a put on is a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;saying that is used to describe someone who is trying to be something or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;someone that they are not. And while that saying may indeed be true in many&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;cases, it obviously is not a term that The Holy Spirit agrees with when it comes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;to describing a born again Christian.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Though perfectly forgiven, no child of God will ever attain sinless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;perfection in this life as long as we dwell in these mortal bodies. Thus, our perfect, heavenly position in Christ is not to be confused with our imperfect, earthly condition that is in the ongoing process of putting on Christ in our day-to-day walk. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;So as this morning begins, let me remind you of what The Spirit of God is up to in our lives. As followers of Jesus, He is allowing us to experience things in our lives that necessitate that we put on the new garments of Christ-likeness, with the greatest garment being His precious love. These garments of compassion, forgiveness, love, peace, worship, and service for our King are the fruit borne by those whose imperfect condition is being gloriously transformed into our heavenly position that we hold in Christ. We are to put on these garments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;because this is who we really are in Christ! We are being renewed in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;knowledge after the image of Him Who created and recreated us.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Put on Christ today beloved, and remember that the practical goal of every follower of Jesus is God-glorifying growth in The Lord, not sinless perfection.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Great Commission</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Matthew 28.18-20 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

Here is the will of God for the church of Jesus Christ. Go, teach, baptize and make disciples. Your mission today as a follower of Jesus rests on Jesus authority as Lord of all. We go in His Name and in with the assurance of His presence. The glorified God- Man has given these marching orders to His children.

This commission is part of the armor of God. Feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. But the daily mission of the church is to be primarily a teaching one. Making disciples. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The teaching ministry is not a group of people sitting around, sipping coffee and telling one another what a passage means to them. That may be a testimony. But the teaching ministry is the proclamation of what God's Word means. Salvation does not release Christians from obedience, but provides solid doctrine from which we are set free from sin and selfishness to a life of obedience to Christs commands.

Let's not turn the great commission into a great convention. Let's not replace the need of teaching into a Christian social club where we simply express our feelings. Making disciples is like raising children. It is intentional. It is methodical. It is a priority that should be held by every local church. The goal is not inclusion into our local "club", but instruction that releases a saint to make a difference for Jesus Christ wherever His Spirit leads them.

Investing in your fellow saints and sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ is the result of sound bible teaching and is as daily and normal as breathing. Paul told pastor Timothy, Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. That is the great commission. That us how disciples are made. Don't change the commission into a program, please.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>God&amp;#039;s promises and tribulation</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Genesis 35 8-22
But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine.

Lots of verses this morning, beloved. But I trust that the word I bring to you will minister peace and comfort. Jesus said, "be of good cheer, in this world you shall have tribulation." Cheer and tribulation? That is the essence of our devotional this morning. Gods grace through The Lord Jesus Christ has not yet fully rescued us from the miseries of sin and death.

It is striking how Gods promises of blessing to Jacob come in the midst of weeping by the graves of three beloved family members, plus grieving over the sin of children. Grace and tears mingle together in this life. But in the midst of our tears, are the exceeding great and precious promises of God.

God remains our Jehovah Jireh, our all sufficient provider in the midst of lives tears, sorrows and disappointments. Jacob built an altar to worship God in the midst of his sorrows and pain. We were created and redeemed to worship God. We sorrow not as others who have no hope. Grace does not remove the consequences and sorrow of sin, it provides for us the promise of a heavenly hope which fades not away. May the presence and promises of Christ give you comfort and strength today, beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Why do you worship God?</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Job 1.9-11 Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.

The first chapter of Job is among the most amazing chapters of Scripture. It takes us behind the scenes of the heavenly realm. It lays out for us this incredible dialogue between Satan and The Lord about Job. Satans accusation of Job is that Job does not worship God for who God is but only for the blessings God gives.

That proposes a very important question for writer and reader alike. Why do we worship God? Though what transpires in this chapter is an attack from the enemy, Job's trial was of divine origin and design. In other words, God controlled the entire trial. After Job lost nearly everything, Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, Naked came I out of my mother's womb,and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. This is a statement of humility and submission to God. He weeps, but he doesn't whine. He worships.

Job declared, blessed be the name of the Lord. Contrary to Satans accusation Job did not curse God. He continued to worship Him even in grief, proving the genuineness of his fear of the Lord. It has been said that the most severe test to our faith comes when circumstances around us are shouting that God must have forsaken us. It is at times of great loss that we discover why we worship God. While we indeed thank God for what she gives us. We worship God for Who He is. All material things will pass away, but The God that we worship lives forever! Worthy is The Lamb! Worship Him today beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Heart Garden</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>The human heart is likened to the ground in Scripture. We see this most evident in Jesus' parable of the sower. This parable explains that the fruit that comes out of a life depends upon the condition of that person's heart. A heart can be hard, without depth, cluttered, or good and honest. Apparently the word of God in and of itself does not produce fruit unless there is the proper "soil" for it to germinate and grow in.

Israel and Judah had drifted from the Lord. They began to walk after vain things. Instead of a constant flow of living waters, their lives became broken and dry. How could they return to that full, rich, loving fellowship with their God? By breaking up the fallow ground of their hearts. The fallow ground is that dormant, untilled, inactive soil.

For the Spirit of God to flow freely, we must guard against areas of hardness toward God's word, and against having our gifts and talents remain dormant.

Good gardens don't just happen, do they? They require attention, weeding, proper sunlight, sufficient watering. Likewise, you and I must also tend to the garden of our hearts with all diligence. The men of Judah got distracted with other things and sowed among the thorns. Jesus tells us that those thorns are the "cares, riches, and pleasures of life". The prophet Hosea encourages us to continue tilling the sod of our hearts in seeking the Lord. God wants our lives fruitful. He does not want weeds that are the fruit of lies.

As our seasons change, may Jesus help each of us to continue sowing His word in good and honest soil. A sure harvest awaits us as we yield to our Lord's providential gardening.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Proverbs 18.10,11 The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.

There are two sources of confidence here. The Name of The Lord and the rich man's wealth. One places faith in God. The other places faith in money. Jesus said of the rich young ruler, children, "how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Jesus also said, "you cannot serve God and mammon". Riches are not sinful, but riches and wealth can give a person a false sense of security. Riches can also be the cause of pride and self-righteousness. Jesus Christ put His finger on the rich young ruler's central problem: a covetous heart.

Our hope must be in God alone, beloved. The opposite of covetousness is contentment. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

In a dog-eat-dog world of greed, may followers of Jesus treasure Jesus Christ above all things. Jesus, not money, is the pearl of great price. Jesus, not money provides all of our need. Never substitute the eternal security that we have in Christ Jesus, for the riches of this crumbling and crashing fallen world system.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>THIS IS WAR!</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Romans 13.11-14 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

With each tick of the clock, our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. It is nearer than when you first started reading this devotional. What does that mean? Dont waste time and be armed for battle against the flesh and the powers of darkness. Paul is exhorting the people of God to live a high standard of moral conduct, particularly in view of the nearness of the Lords return, when our salvation will be consummated. The way to living holy for Christ in a Christ less world is twofold. First, we must put on the Lord Jesus Christ. That means that we submit to His lordship. We accept His Word as His will for our lives. That means that we must abide in constant fellowship with Him, and draw upon His strength. Secondly, we are to make no provision for the flesh, doing nothing to that would feed our always-craving sensual desires and appetites.

Simply put, the Christian life is no joke. It is not for the weak at heart. It is an all out war against as enemy within and the forces of darkness in the world. Paul tells us to not make provision for our flesh for the simple reason that our flesh is constantly making demands to be provided for. The word provision means to give forethought to. It is a conscious, willful plan. Thus, we need to be sober and aware of the ever-present danger of seeking to delight in and make provision for the very things that Jesus Christ redeemed us from. 

Recognizing the danger and challenge that the flesh poses to the Christians spiritual health and witness, the apostle Paul instructs us to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts. To make no provision for the flesh means that we must put off the old clothes that we wore before we belonged to Jesus. We must cast off the sinful works of darkness and put on the armour of light. Beloved, Jesus is nearer than when we first believed. The Christian life is a Spirit filled, intentional walk, that is constantly depending upon The Lord for the strength and grace to walk in the light as He is in the light. Be strong in The Lord and in the power of His might today, beloved!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Be of Good Cheer</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>In the second chapter of Mark, we find Jesus ministering forgiveness and healing to a man who was unable to walk. Man, by natural birth, is lame, dead in trespasses and sins. Christians can truly rejoice because, through Jesus' atoning work on Calvary, our names are written in heaven. I find tucked away in this wonderful gospel account, which typifies salvation in so many ways, a beautiful revelation of the God of peace and comfort. When Jesus saw true faith in action, Matthew tells us that He said to the man sick of the palsy, "Be of good cheer."

It is significant and worth noting wherever Jesus speaks these words in the Scriptures:"Be of good cheer."Here it was to a physical wreck that the Savior whispered"Be of good cheer." Hurting saints, look to Jesus and hear Him speak those same healing words to your heart today. Never doubt that a new day is coming when your healing, even if it doesn't arrive in this life, will nonetheless manifest itself permanently.

A second place where Jesus speaks these words is in the account of the disciples on the Sea of Galilee when their boat was being "tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary." When the disciples saw Jesus coming toward them walking on the water, they cried out in fear. What did Jesus say to His frightened, faithless followers? "Be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid."In other words, He was assuring them: You know Me, and I know your situation. Your storm is not greater than I am. I am here with you in the storm, and very soon I will remove the storm. To those of you in the midst of some storm of life right now Jesus says, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."

One last Biblical locations of Jesus' encouraging words is found following a riot Paul started before the Jewish council. Paul had been physically roughed up and probably felt dejected because he had thought for sure that if anyone loved his fellow Jews and had the credentials to reach them, he was that person. He must have needed encouragement. And who stood by him? None other than Jesus, who spoke to Paul those precious words of cheer once again.

Whether we are suffering physically, battling the storms of life, or simply feel dejected at our apparent failures, Jesus remains the same and speaks lovingly to our hearts: "Be of good cheer!"</ns3:encoded>

		<title>A priesthood of ministers</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Exodus 28.3,4 And thou shalt speak to all that are wise in heart, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office. And these are the garments which they shall make; a breast-plate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a miter, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.

1 Peter 2.9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

God calls His people those who are set apart to minister unto Him. Think on that for a moment. It is so easy to define ministry in terms of what we do, where we do it and do on and so forth. In one sense, that is true of course if you are speaking in terms of geography or identity. But all true ministry within the body of Christ is first and foremost vertical and unto The Lord. In other words, our calling each and every day as the royal priesthood is to minister as unto The Lord. In as much as you have done it unto the least of these My brethren, you have done it unto Me. How we need this Godward, Christ-ward ministry perspective in our churches.

The church is really a hospital that is made up of sinners with various degrees of wounds, sicknesses and shortcomings. Until we are taken to heaven, thebody is a patient in God's hospital. Nobody has it all together. There is only One Doctor on staff. We all hurt at one time or another. We all grieve or find ourselves in financial need at one time or another. We all get discouraged or feel defeated at times. It is when we have this vertical, Jesus-focused view of ministering that the church is at its finest.

Oh, how Jesus is glorified when we quietly meet that need of another saint, as unto Him. Oh, how Jesus is glorified when we weep with those who weep, as unto Him. Oh, how Jesus is glorified when we take the time to hear that troubled or difficult soul's story before we pull the trigger of self-righteous condemnation.

My prayer today for the body of Christ is that each and every local church would be clothed with the garments of Christ-like love, humility, grace and kindness. That our hearts and attitudes towards one another would be tender and full of understanding. When The Lord opens my eyes to see Jesus in you, and vice versa, it is amazing how differently I look at your hurt, pain or need. When we realize that we have been saved to do all things as unto Jesus, our churches will truly be filled with compassion and caring souls who help one another grow in grace and in the knowledge of God, for the glory of God.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>For Those Who Are Overwhelmed</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Psalm 61 is Gods prescription for those who are overwhelmed.  Face it, life tends to be quite overwhelming in and of itself, apart from all of the added difficulties that we encounter along the way.  My question for you today is this: should there not be a significant difference between a disciple of Christ and a non-believer when life gets tough?
     	
Oh course there should.  Even within the body of Christ, what really separates those who conquer from those who fail?  Is it not the individuals response towards Christ and his perception of the situation?  

What do you do when you are overwhelmed?  David, the man of God, would reply, Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.  Isnt that what we are supposed to do?  Is that not what it means in Romans 12:12, where we are exhorted to be continuing steadfastly in prayer?  David said, Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I. 
      	
We are not supposed to be the rock; thats secular counsel.  Jesus is the Rock to whom we turn.  Only He can put out the fires of life and calm the raging sea of adversity.  Do you believe that today?  Do you believe that with all of your heart?
     	
You see, Jesus is a risen Savior, and that is a fact!  However, if your prayer life is clouded with doubt and unbelief of that fact, Im afraid you are doing nothing more than wishing for things to take a turn for the good.
     	
Is Jesus your Rock today?  If so, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you!  We must hide in our heart these precious truths, or Im afraid some of us would be found believing in vain.  
     	
No, Jesus is not a crutch  Hes more!  Hes our Shelter and strong Tower.  May Gods grace teach us how to lean upon our Savior.  Hes accessible every second.  He cares for you!  When we know that, I mean really know that, then we can sing praises to Him forever.  
     	
Remember, when feeling overwhelmed, do first what you usually do last  pause (selah) and pray, and believe everything is going to be just fine because God has promised that it would be.  You are surrounded by an immovable Rock, and His name is Jesus!</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Numbers 32:11-12  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the Lord.

Acts 17:16  Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

There is no such thing as neutrality when it comes to spiritual things. You cannot be a half Christian; neither can you be a half follower of the world. You are either all in, or you are all out. Jesus told the lukewarm Laodiceans that they would be spit out of His mouth (Revelation 3:14-16). A person is either on the narrow path that leads to life, or they are on the broad path that leads to destruction and death.

It is unfortunate that we have created paths to accommodate unbelief and carnality. That is not to say that being in Christ is a battle-free, temptation-free zone. No, there is warfare and the constant need to lay aside things that beset us in our walk with Jesus. But the battles and disciplines exist because we have chosen to follow Christ and seek first His kingdom. Caleb and Joshua wholly followed The Lord. The city of Athens was wholly given to idolatry. The two cannot peacefully coexist within any human being. You cannot serve God and mammon. (Matthew 6:24)

There is a credit card commercial that ends by asking the question, Whats in your wallet? I ask you, my dear Selah family, what are you wholly given to, Jesus Christ or idolatry? The answer is either for me to live is Christ and His kingdom, or for me to live is me and the idolatrous kingdom of this world. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Good News, Not Good Advice</title>

Revelation 5:9  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;

 

     Is it just me, or are some of you getting burned out with all of the conversations and conspiracy theories about COVID 19, and the unrest that is going on in our nation? On top of that, there are the everyday issues and challenges of life that you and I are facing. There is lots of sad news out there. There is a lot of anger and frustration and despair. We are a planet that is confronted with problems and pains that are beyond human control.     

     But this morning I have good news for you. Great news! God is on the throne and His eternal plan of redemption is right on schedule, and no virus, riot, political party, or demons are going to stop it! Hallelujah!! The Lord God Almighty reigns (Revelation 19:6). We will be looking at Revelation chapter 5 this morning. We are going to see beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jesus Christ is The One Who breaks the 7-sealed book that brings about the final stages of human history, as we know it. In heaven, the apostle John sees The Lord Jesus as both a Lion and a slain Lamb. He has risen. He has conquered sin and death. All heaven breaks loose with praise and worship unto Him that sits upon the throne. Worthy is The Lamb! While you and I are debating over COVID and protests, and are trying to figure out when are we going to reopen our churches, the redeemed in heaven are worshipping Him Who sits upon the throne.

     The throng around the throne consists of every tribe, every tongue, every people and every nation because in the redemptive heart of The Living God, ALL lives matter. The gospel of Jesus Christ is Good News. Religion is good advice - something that you must do to get right with God. The gospel is the good news of what Jesus Christ has done to forgive us of our sin and adopt us into the family of God. The singular mission of the Church is to preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15). We are not called to be activists. We are not called to preach politics, religion, racism, or nationalism. We are called to declare the good news of Jesus Christ. All of mankinds problems on earth are sin issues, and every human being is born into this world S-I-N positive. The only cure for sin is Jesus Christ. That is the message that the Church needs to be spreading because that is the message that will change the world, one soul at a time. Selah.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage portrays the righteous as having a positive influence on others, a secure future, and a joyful outlook. In contrast, the wicked are harmful to others, they will face Gods judgment, and they have no real hope. Fearing the Lord leads to righteousness, but rejecting His ways yields wickedness. Please open your Bible to Proverbs ten, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola concludes his discussion of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage reveals the power of righteousness and the downfall of wickedness in different aspects of life. We should avoid the risks of being surety for a stranger. Neither should we be ruthless, deceitful, perverse, or greedy. Instead, we shoud be merciful, generous, wise, and faithful. God loves those that cheerfully minister to the needs of others instead of selfishly hoarding their resources. Please open your Bible to Proverbs eleven, verse fifteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his discussion of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage provides godly wisdom about discipline, righteousness, honesty, diligence, and friendship. As seen before, the Lord blesses those who follow His ways and that live with integrity. However, He will condemn those who do evil and lie. Accordingly, the righteous will prosper and endure, while the wicked will suffer and perish. Please open your Bible to Proverbs twelve, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins todays study.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage contrasts outcomes for the righteous and the wicked, the diligent and the lazy, the wise and the foolish. It teaches that those who work hard, speak truthfully, listen to advice, and care for others will have abundant life and favor from the Lord. However, those who chase fantasies, lie, despise correction, and plot evil will face trouble and ruin. Please open your Bible to Proverbs twelve, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage reminds us of the power of words: not only the words that we say, but also the words to which we listen. Therefore, we should be careful about what we say, and also use care in choosing what we hear. Listening to Gods word and obeying His commandments are keys to a full and productive life, but our pride can prevent us from benefiting from godly instruction. Please open your Bible to Proverbs thirteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;A persons attitude toward Gods word is a matter of life and death. Despising the word of the Lord is like pushing a self-destruct button. However, God will abundantly reward those that trust in His word and obey His commandments to love God and to love our neighbor. Please open your Bible to Proverbs thirteen, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>Psalms 31:24 "Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD."

Good morning, dear ones! None of us know what this day will bring forth, but this much we do know: we can rejoice because our names are written in The Lamb's Book of Life! Blessed be the love and grace of God Who has redeemed us by the perfect sacrifice of His Son Jesus Christ.

Our passage of Scripture from Psalms tells us that for those who hope is in The Lord, we can be of good courage and He will strengthen our hearts. Isn't that beautiful? The Hebrew word that is translated hope here means "to wait for." To wait for The Lord is the same as placing your hope and trust in The Lord. So as you go about your day today, pray about everything and for everything. Understand that hoping in The Lord is not sitting in a rocking chair, doing nothing. It is literally waiting on Him, as a waiter or waitress waits on your table. It is being engaged in doing God's will in whatever is placed in front of you today. As we wait on The Lord, our hearts are strengthened and filled with a holy courage that is rooted in the grace of God and His unconditional love for us.

Thus today, Psalms 27:14 "Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. Psalm 29.11 "Know this, The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace." Psalms 146:5 "Happy [is he] that [hath] the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope [is] in the LORD his God."

Hope in God today, beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Psalm 111 - A Psalm of Praise</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=1579</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 111 &lt;/strong&gt;is one of the acrostic Psalms. In the acrostics of the OT, each line or verse begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, beginning with Aleph and ending with Tau.

This particular psalm of praise recalls the Exodus, the wilderness wanderings, and the conquest of the Promised Land. It is a beautiful picture of Gods ultimate conquest and deliverance of sinners, by grace through faith in the atoning sacrifice and resurrection of The Lamb of God, The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.1 Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 111 &lt;/strong&gt;is one of the Hallelujah or Praise The Lord Psalms. This is a corporate psalm of praise to God for His faithfulness to His people and for the wondrous works He has done.

&lt;strong&gt;My whole heart-&lt;/strong&gt; This speaks of the totality our being in worship of The Lord. Worship of God engages our minds, our affections and our wills. Worship engages our thoughts and emotions, as well as our voices. Worship of God is always vertical and with undivided affections; holding back nothing. Many of the expressions of worship in the psalms are described by verbs like, shout, lifting hands, clap, etc. Worship of God is passionate and from the depth of our heart.

&lt;strong&gt;In the congregation- &lt;/strong&gt;While worship is a private matter. God has also designed gatherings for corporate worship.

The Lord Jesus Himself is an example of worship within the community of saints. The Messianic 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Psalm writes this about Jesus: **&lt;strong&gt;I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation. Psalm 22.22,25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.2 The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The works of The Lord are great-&lt;/strong&gt; They are great in number; great in magnitude; great in wisdom; great in goodness; great in intensity.

&lt;em&gt;How great are the works of Him Who gives to every plant its leaf and flower and fruit; to every animal its faculties and functions; to every man his understanding, affections, and will. &lt;/em&gt;Samuel Summers

When we seek out the works of The Lord in both creation and redemption, they become a source of great delight and pleasure.

The testimony of the redeemed in heaven is:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rev 15.3Great and marvellous&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true&lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;Thy ways, thou King of saints.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Gods works are expressions of His character.

His majesty&lt;strong&gt; (vs 2); &lt;/strong&gt;His glory and righteousness&lt;strong&gt; (vs 3); &lt;/strong&gt;His grace and compassion&lt;strong&gt; (vs 4); &lt;/strong&gt;His faithfulness&lt;strong&gt; (vs 5); &lt;/strong&gt;His power&lt;strong&gt; (vs 6): &lt;/strong&gt;His holiness&lt;strong&gt; (vs 9).&lt;/strong&gt;

Have you lost that sense of the greatness and glory of God? Pray this
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 33:3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.3 His work is honourable and glorious: and His righteousness endureth for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;His work is honorable and glorious- &lt;/strong&gt;literally, &lt;em&gt;Honor and glory is His work&lt;/em&gt;; beloved, all that God does is honorable and glorious.Behold what He is doing right here and right now is honorable and glorious.

Every act of God is abounding with glorious majesty.

&lt;strong&gt;His righteousness- &lt;/strong&gt;This of course ultimately points to Jesus Christ, The Son of God and His righteousness that endures forever. When we take The Lords Supper together this morning, we will be thanking God for His unfailing righteousness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.4 He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Literally, &lt;em&gt;Memory hath he made for his wonderful works&lt;/em&gt;. The highest and most appropriate exercise of memory is to retain and treasure the lessons that the works of God teach. God did not create a universe so that we would worship creation. He created the universe in order that we might marvel, and treasure and worship Him, The Maker of heaven and earth.

It is a sad commentary that we tend to forget what we are told remember, and remember what we are told to forget.

&lt;strong&gt;Gracious and full of compassion- &lt;/strong&gt;This is The God that we worship, He is gracious and full of compassion. Jesus said, Follow Me. In other words, be like Me. May God baptize this body of saints to be a body that is following the example of Jesus by being gracious and full of compassion.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.5 He hath given meat unto them that fear Him:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He will ever be mindful of His covenant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;He will ever be mindful of his covenant -&lt;/strong&gt;He will never leave or forsake His people; He will be faithful to all the promises that he has made to them.

Encouragement from the past: "&lt;strong&gt;He hath given meat&lt;/strong&gt;."

Confidence for the future: "&lt;strong&gt;He will ever be mindful&lt;/strong&gt;."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.6 He hath shewed His people the power of His works, that He may give them the heritage of the heathen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The power of His works. &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, the works that only God can do. The gospel that we are remembering this morning as we partake of The Lords Supper is the power of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romans 1.16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Corinthians 1.18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Heritage of the heathen- &lt;/strong&gt;This is a reference to Jehovah giving the land of Canaan to Israel.

The church has no such earthly inheritance.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hebrews 13.14 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. &lt;/strong&gt;We are looking for that heavenly city that Jesus spoke about &lt;strong&gt;whos builder and Maker is God (Hebrews 11.10).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.7 The works of His hands are verity (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;absolute truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) and judgment (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;faithful and right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;); all His commandments are sure (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fixed, established and trustworthy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Truth and uprightness- &lt;/strong&gt;God always acts according to the glorious principles of truth and integrity. There is no shadow of darkness in anything that God does. Whatever God has promised, He will bring to pass, in His way and in His time.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.9 He sent redemption unto His people: He hath commanded His covenant for ever: holy and reverend is His name.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Redemption-&lt;/strong&gt; The psalmist has in mind the great acts of redemption that God performed in their past. Redemption is the gift of God that grants salvation from sins debt; sins penalty; sins condemnation and sins misery through the gospel of Jesus Christy.

The most spectacular work of God that is to be remembered (vs.4) is His work of redemption.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Whom we have redemption, even the remission of sins. Ephesians 1.7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus said, speaking of The Lords Supper, &lt;strong&gt;do this in remembrance of Me. &lt;/strong&gt;The Lords Supper is a covenant meal that is to be remembered.

&lt;em&gt;Redemption is a fit theme for the heartiest music&lt;/em&gt;. Spurgeon

&lt;strong&gt;Reverend- &lt;/strong&gt;Fearful, awe-inspiring.

&lt;strong&gt;His Name- &lt;/strong&gt;His Name speaks of God in all of His attributes and perfections. Gods Name is to be revered because God is holy. (&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 6; Revelation 4&lt;/strong&gt;).

Only Gods Name is holy and reverend. There is absolutely nothing holy or reverend about either the name Raymond or Viola.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;111.10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments: His praise endureth for ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fear of The Lord- &lt;/strong&gt;The proper response to all that God is and what He has done is one of reverential fear. To fear the Lord is to trust in Him, obey Him, and worship Him as God and Savior.

The fear of The Lord is both a shrinking back from the holiness of God out of a sense of awe, and at the same time, the fear of The Lord is an attraction to Him out of a sense of adoration and wonder.

&lt;strong&gt;Is the beginning of wisdom- &lt;/strong&gt;Men can never begin to be wise until they begin to fear God. PhDs. Degrees and diplomas do not make a person wise, the fear of God does.

&lt;strong&gt;A good understanding have all they that do His commandments. &lt;/strong&gt;Where the fear of the Lord rules in the heart, there will be a delight and a desire to walk after His commandments; not to just talk of them, but to do them.

Do you want a life that is a snare and bondage? Fear man and desire the fallen thrills and pleasures of the world.

Do want a life that is blessed? Fear God and walk after His commandments.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blessed is the man that feareth The Lord, walks in His ways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecclesiastes 12.13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His praise endureth forever-&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Revelation 4 &amp;amp; 5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Today, we are observing the two ordinances that God has left for His church to observe. The Lord Supper and Water Baptism.

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Lords Supper&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 1 Corintians 1.30,31&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In verses 5 and 9 we see reference to &lt;strong&gt;His covenant. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 26.26-28 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And now, let us prayerfully observe the power of God at work in the lives of these saints who are publically professing their faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Psalm 68.19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.

A very short devotional this morning, beloved. Inspired by words that my daughter spoke to my wife and the conversation of saints after a memorial service. God loads us daily with His benefits. If God were only to give you today, the things for which you thanked Him for yesterday, what would you be left with?

In everything, give thanks. Do not take the blessings, family, church family or friends that God in His providence has brought into your life for granted. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Come after Me</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 1.17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.

Come ye after me. The gospel or good news demands following Jesus Christ in submission to His teaching, communion and fellowship with His person, and imitation of His example. Come after Me.

We hear a lot about cultivating relationships these days. While scripture indeed speaks of the cultivation of various kinds of relationships. The emphasis in scripture is on one vertical relationship, and that being with Christ; with the overflow of that relationship (singular) bring the source of grace, love and understanding that we need in our horizontal relationships. When the vertical, "come unto Me" is intact, the horizontal will fall into place.

Come unto Me is what our day today should be all about. And lest we forget why we have been redeemed, we learn here that Jesus specifically called these disciples to a new vocation, the work of preaching the gospel to gather people into the kingdom. Come unto Me will always result in a Spirit-led evangelism as well as the practical practice of living out the many "one another's" in Scripture.

Concentrate on the "come after Me", beloved. When we make the vertical the priority, the love your neighbor as yourself will "just happen." Come unto Me. Follow Me. Learn of Me. Abide in Me. Do not complicate the simplicity of loving and following Jesus, friends.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>He saw their faith</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 2.5-7 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?

Jesus saw the faith of both the paralytic and of his friends. He saw their faith in Him. But He saw something much deeper than what they came to Him for. They came for a physical need (which Jesus met), but he had a sick soul that needed forgiveness.

Jesus Christ sees through our apparent needs to our deepest need. How we need to remember that. The cry of the urgent often overshadows a much deeper need. Our greatest need is always spiritual. Forgiveness of sin can only come by faith in Christ. "To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."

The scribes were correct. The prophet Isaiah wrote, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake,
and will not remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified."

Nehemiah wrote, "thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness." Daniel wrote, "To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness."

We are like this paralytic man in need of forgiveness. We are like his friends who think we know what we need most. Faith in Christ receives what He provides and thanks him for it. If God were only to give us today, the things that we were thankful for yesterday, what would you have, beloved? Thank God for Jesus and all His benefits!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Salty Saints</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 9.49,50 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

Old Testament offerings involved salt as a sign of covenant faithfulness. In those days, salt was used to preserve food, and also as an antiseptic. We also know that salt in the ancient world was a mixture of minerals, and the sodium chloride could leach away by moisture, leaving behind useless minerals. Thus, the teaching of Jesus is very clear. The Christian man, woman or church is called to have a redemptive influence in the world. The church is called to impact the world for Christ, not the other way around.

I fear that the world is influencing the church more than the church is influencing the world. We hear a lot these days about the need for the church to adapt to the culture. Yes, we need to meet people right where they are at, like Jesus did. But nobody who met Jesus could ever stay the same. The salt of Christ's life and message demanded a change. No compromise. No philosophical appeals to "soften the blow" of our sin.

Modern day evangelism rarely quotes these words of Jesus when preaching the gospel. "And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

These were the words of Grace Incarnate. These are still the conditions needed to be "the salt of the earth" in a fallen world. The world is constantly pressuring Christs disciples to compromise. The world hates salt. The flesh hates salt. The natural man despises being crucified. Dear ones, to be a salty Christian we mustreject the world and put all our hope in Christ.

The only soul that can make an impact in this life forJesus Christ is a salty one. When the church loses its salt; it loses its significance. It is good for nothing. Being salt is not a loveless, cold hearted, in-your-face life. It is a no-nonsense, no compromise, unashamed love for Jesus that follows Him and His kingdom, not the culture and its broken values. You cannot follow Jesus and the world, because no man can have two masters. Be salty, beloved.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Matthew 5.13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

These are the words of Salt Incarnate, Jesus Christ. He is speaking to His disciples. This is before He goes to the cross and is raised from the dead. He is describing the kind of life that we are to live in a world that is fallen, broken and lost. We are to live a life that brings healing, truth and life to those who are sick, seduced by lies and dead in trespasses and sins. The body of Christ is a mobile hospital on two legs. We are to be a Christ-driven, love-driven people. But once again we hear Jesus say that salt that has lost its flavor is good for nothing.

Salt in a wound will cause an impact that will result in the healing of an infection. Salt in your food will enhance the food you are eating by adding flavor to it. Salt will make a difference. But real salt cannot be neutral. When we read the gospels, we see that Salt Incarnate was moved with compassion when He saw the lost. So should we be.

Salt Incarnate was angry when His Father's house was being used as a means of financially ripping off the people of God. So should we. Salt Incarnate rebuked those who elevated man-made traditions above obedience to the Word of God. So should we. Salt Incarnate laid the truth right on the table to the rich young ruler, Nicodemus, the woman at the well and the self-righteous religionists of His day. So should we. Salt Incarnate was a friend of publicans and sinners. So should we. Salt Incarnate would say to those that savored the will of man over the will of God, get thee behind me Satan. So should we.

Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. It is useless to try to influence others for good if things are not right with us, beginning with our relationships within the church. If the church loses its salt, will it cancel itself out? When The Son of Man returns, will He find faith on the earth? May we drop our swords of philosophical nonsense, spun with a religious twist and really be followers of Salt Incarnate, beloved. When we are following Jesus, we will be rubbing the salt of God into people's lives, not some homespun tapestry of terminology that means absolutely nothing to someone who is sick, deceived and dead.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>God&amp;#039;s presence for a troubled church</title>

		<ns3:encoded>2 Corinthians 13.14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen

The letters of Paul to the church of Corinth are filled with reproof, rebukes, corrections and warnings. They were divided over their favorite teacher. They were lenient in dealing with sexual sin. They were flagrant in flaunting their "liberty" in Christ. They turned the Lord's Supper into a banquet that divided the have's and have not's. Their usage of spiritual gifts were way out of order. They were carnal. And yet, they were sanctified in Christ Jesus.

Can you believe it, beloved? A church having all of these problems under the watch of apostles Peter and Paul? Lest we forget, Every single Christian and every single congregation falls short of the glory of God. Sinless perfection is a state that is reserved for heaven. Until we get to heaven, we are all a work in progress. While it is vital for us to repent when we are guilty of sin or wrongdoing. It is equally true that we should always seek to use those moments of tension, or conflict or sin as opportunities to grow and to move on in The Lord together.

Repeatedly, Paul tells these saints that they belong to Jesus Christ. They are not disjointed parts of His body who are able to ignore their need of one another. They are not independent parts who can do their own thing without any regard for one another. They are to walk in the love, forgiveness and grace of God towards one another. They are to walk in the shadow of the cross and the power of the empty tomb! They are twice born, new creatures in Christ whose enemy is the devil, whose number one problem is their own flesh, whose constant source of temptation is this fallen world system's way of thinking and living.

Paul did not hold back any punches. But his goal was not to beat them up, but to build them up. So how does Paul end his correspondence to this heaven bound church that is riddled with many problems? The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen. He prays for the presence of The Lord's grace, love and communion. Put down your swords. Put away your divisive and selfish living. Forgive one another. Walk in love, not lust.

Years ago I heard Pastor Chuck Smith say at a pastors conference these words, "When the body of Christ is divided, Who bleeds?" The blood of Christ on the cross was shed to unite us, not divide us. May every incident and revelation of imperfection and wrongdoing in the church drive us to Christ and bring forth the fruit of repentance and forgiveness instead of rip us apart and give place to the flesh and the devil. So to you my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The dangers of division</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Romans 16.17,18 Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create dissensions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned. Avoid them! For these are the kind who do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By their smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of the naive.(Net Bible)

One of the things that God hates is the sowing of discord among the brethren. The division surrounding Jesus is not to exist between those who are born again, but between those who are born again and those who are lost. This is clearly seen in many places. God's people are sheep. Those who are not born again are goats.

So, since God hates division and sowing discord, take a wild guess at one of the most effective weapons the devil uses to divide the blood bought, twice born, body of Christ? A divisive spirit. It was alive and well in Corinth. There were saints who were born again, but they were poisoned in their minds by a spirit of division. "For it hath been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by them who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"

Later on Paul repeats this rebuke. "For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?" That is heavy stuff! I can see in my mind a sign over the church door at Corinth, wear a hard hat, the devil is at work.

It is clear to me that the people Paul is referring to in our opening passages were the false brethren, the Judaizers who mixed the dietary laws and circumcision as being necessary for a person to be saved. They were preaching another Jesus. Another gospel. They were accursed and to be marked. They would be likened to Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses, who claim to be preaching Christ and His Gospel, but hold to unbiblical views of Christ and the gospel. But many people today use these passages in Romans to refer to those within the body of Christ who do not agree with them on non-foundational points of bible truth, things that are notessential for salvation. This to me is dangerous.

Beyond the absolute foundational truths of God, Christ and His gospel, and the inerrancy of Spirit-inspired Scripture, there are differences of views within the body of Christ on so many issues. Why? We see through a glass darkly. There is only one body of Christ. There are many members in this body. The eye and ear look nothing alike but need one another. If you dig deep enough into any legitimate ministry within the body of Christ, you will find some error. Only Christ's ministry on earth was sinless, flawless.

Beware of those who tell you to mark those in the body of Christ because they do not follow their code of interpretations or style of worship, teaching or church government. Sad but true, a divisive spirit often turns into hatred and rejection. To disagree on secondary points does not make one a heretic or a false brother. But as long as the body of Christ is functioning on this carnal level, the house of God will remain divided and fighting against one another. The devil himself cannot be more pleased than when he can use the body of Christ to do his work for him. Lord have mercy on us. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>A Recipe of Faith</title>

		<ns3:encoded>John 6.5,6 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he saith to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat? (And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.)

2 Chronicles 20.12 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

These two incidents, one from each testament, provide us with a mini lesson on our need to trust God. While the situations are completely different, the need for God's miraculous power and intervention was the same. In the only miracle (other than the resurrection of Jesus from the dead) recorded in all four gospels, Jesus tells Phillip to buy bread for this massive crowd. Where are we supposed to find this much bread? The local bakery is closed! But this was a test for Phillip. The Lord knew what He would do. Overwhelming circumstances or needs are tests. They cannot be figured out logically. Thus, we must walk by faith, and trust in God. Only He can do the impossible.

The second situation was one of a more serious nature. The people of God were outnumbered and outgunned by their enemies. King Jehoshaphat does a wise thing. He calls for a time of prayer and fasting and then declares, we have no clue what to do (sound familiar?), but our eyes are on You. The lesson? Keep your eyes on The Lord. The bible is filled with countless stories of how God moved amongst His people in time of great need or times of danger. Those were not just some "cute" stories written by a God Who got bored to death and decided to write a New York Times best seller!

Beloved, life is full of challenges, questions, needs and dangers. They are inescapable and unavoidable. Jesus has a plan. Keep your eyes on Him. Praise Him, like the Israelites did. Obey His command like the apostles did. Doubt your doubts, not your Lord! He Is faithful!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Old Rugged Cross</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>One of the most loved hymns of the church is the old rugged cross. The chorus says, "So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, til my trophies at last I lay down. I will cling to the old rugged cross, and exchange it someday for a crown." Oh how true! The cross meant everything to Paul. It was not only the place where Jesus bore his sin debt. It was the place where he died with Jesus to religion, self, and the false glamor of this fallen world system. When Paul went to sophisticated Corinth, he didn't preach a series of Christian lectures. Pauls sole desire for going to Corinth was to preach the message of the cross. Not as a stimulating speech, but as an ultimatum. It was not his desire to impress them with eloquence or sophisticated language, lest their faith rest (stand ) in his abilities as a speaker.

Here in Galatia, there were false teachers who were insisting on adding the ritual of circumcision to the work of Jesus on the cross as necessary for one's salvation. To any who proclaim's a "gospel" message of Jesus+anything = salvation, listen to what Paul says. I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.

Boasting in the cross of Jesus Christ is like talking about how fond you are of electric chairs. The cross is a message of death. Death to sin. Death to self. Death to religious systems. Death to this world. In the heavenly scene, John said, "I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain." The slain Lamb on the old rugged cross is the message that will inspire our worship throughout all eternity.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Ephesians &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;5:15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,16 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

Psalm 1:1-3 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

No, I am not an old Scrooge who is down on technology or social media. It is a blessing to receive e-cards, catch up with old friends, and read Scripture postings or edifying blogs. But my brain is on a technology, social media overload these days. Today as I was getting ready to leave the office, I took a few minutes to browse over Facebook. Got in my car, sat down and shrugged my shoulders. I got mad. I got sad. Some of the posts were downright mean and nasty. Some were vulgar. Are you following me? Then that precious still, small voice said to my soul, Raymond, it is more edifying for you to keep your face in My Book and draw closer to Me, than spend your time on Facebook and walk away empty.

We find the time to do whatever is of value or important for us, don't we? What could possibly be more valuable than hearing what our Wonderful and Glorious God has to say to us? I'd rather hear one word from Him than read a thousand words of any other person. I am not a kill joy. I do enjoy the good and edifying, faith-building things on social media. I love to share what God shares with me in hopes that others would be drawn closer to Him and His Book. Beloved brothers and sisters in Jesus, what The Lord has to say to us is far more important and edifying than any posting on any social media. I need to spend more time in prayer and with my face in His Book than with Facebook. How about you?</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Scripture tells us that there are only two paths that a person can follow. A wise person will choose the path that leads to God and eternal life. However, many people, even some that mean well, are on a different path that leads to death. Do you know which path that you are on? Fortunately, Jesus has made it possible to leave the path that leads to destruction if you repent and walk with Him! Please open your Bible to Proverbs fourteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage invites us to reflect on the choices we make and the paths we take in life. Scripture encourages us to seek wisdom, integrity, truth, and reverence for God, as these are the sources of lasting happiness and fulfillment. We should avoid folly, deception, mockery, and rashness, because these are the causes of misery and ruin. Please open your Bible to Proverbs fourteen, verse seven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola continues his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage contrasts the consequences of wisdom and folly, righteousness and wickedness, and generosity and oppression. Those that fear the Lord will act prudently, and they will be kind to the poor. Such people will find life, security, and honor. However, those that are quick-tempered, evil, and deceitful will face hatred, ruin, and death. Please open your Bible to Proverbs fourteen, verse sixteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage contrasts the broad and narrow ways of which Jesus spoke in His Sermon on the Mount. However, we will be hearing about Solomons wise words that contrasted the ways of the wise and the foolish, the righteous and the wicked, and the gentle and the harsh. He emphasized the power of words, the fear of the Lord, and the consequences of actions. Solomon offered practical guidance for living a life of peace, joy, and blessing. Please open your Bible to Proverbs fifteen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage invites us to discover godly wisdom that leads to life and joy. God loves us and disciplines us for our good. Therefore, we should humble ourselves and fear Him. We should use our words to bless and not to curse. We should seek and give wise counsel, for in the multitude of counselors there is safety.

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage contrasts the peace found in simple living with the strife that can accompany wealth, and it underscores the folly of repaying kindness with evil. This is not to be confused with God refining His children through trials. Such trials teach us the value of godly wisdom as we navigate lifes challenges. Please open your Bible to Proverbs seventeen, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage emphasizes wisdom, discipline, and understanding in human behavior. Solomon warned against folly and the consequences of evil actions, while highlighting the value of a calm spirit and a discerning heart. He also underscored the importance of godly speech in contrast to the folly of quarreling. Wisdom is found in those who hold their tongues and seek knowledge. Please open your Bible to Proverbs seventeen, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage emphasizes the power of the word, and the importance of wise speech in shaping life and relationships. Solomon contrasted the folly of isolation with the value of true companionship, and underscored the need for humility and discernment. Fools do not believe in the God that created the universe. They take no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing their own opinions. This leads to conflict and dishonor. Please open your Bible to Proverbs eighteen, and join Pastor Ray Viola as he begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<title>Fellowship In The Gospel</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=47</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>This morning we are talking about the importance of fellowship. First of all, what does the word fellowship mean? The English word fellowship is a translation of the Greek word koinonia. The exact definition of that word according to Strongs concordance reads as follows: partnership, i.e. (literally) participation, or (social) intercourse, or (pecuniary) benefaction:--(to) communicate(-ation), communion, (contri-)distribution, fellowship.

This clearly speaks of deliberate interaction within a community. It is the people of God deliberately interacting with one another and being involved in one anothers lives for the glory of God. The apostle John said it this way: That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. (1 John 1:3) So, this fellowship that you and I are to have with one another is rooted in the fellowship that we share with The Father and His Son Jesus Christ. The overflow of our fellowship with Christ will be fellowship with one another. According to 1st Corinthians 12, the body of Christ is made up of many members who are knit together by divine design. Just like our human bodies are fearfully and wonderfully made, the body of Christ is made up of many members. Each local congregation is made up of many members who are to pursue fellowship with one another. Each local congregation is in itself a part of the larger body of Christ, within which we seek fellowship as well.

Practically speaking, the way that God has designed for the body to interact can be seen in the various one another passages of Scripture found in the New Testament. Lets look at a few. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. (John 13:14). In other words, our fellowship is to be rooted in humility and in serving one another. A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. (John 13:34) Another mark of fellowship with one another is that it is sacrificial and not selfish. In honor we are to give preference to one another (Romans 12:10). We are to esteem others over ourselves (Philippians 2:3). Other Scriptures instruct us to: forgive one another (Ephesians 4:32), exhort one another (Hebrews 3:13, 10:25), bear one anothers burdens (Galatians 6:2), and consider one another (Hebrews 10:24).Thus biblical fellowship includes a social aspect, but it is much deeper than that.

Fellowship is something that I must both seek and give. This friendly association and spiritual communion is something that we all need. At the end of the day, you and I get as much fellowship within the body as we pursue it and extend it to others.

		<title>Believing God</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=1693</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Galatians 3.5,6 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he this by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

Did you know that there is a vast difference between believing in God and believing God? Believing in God only means that I am not a fool. But just because I may claim to believe in God, that does not mean that I believe Him in a trusting, saving way. In John 7, we read the account of Jesus' dialogue with His earthly brothers. They obviously believed in His personhood. They "knew" His Name. But when they challenged Him to go up to the Feast of Tabernacles and perform some miracles to "prove" Who He was, we read, "for neither did his brethren believe in Him." They did not believe in Him.

Do you see the difference between believing in God in your head, and believing God in your heart? One is factual, the other is transformational. James tells us, "thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble." What! The devils believe, and they tremble. See the difference? Beloved, it is possible to have a bookworm, head knowledge of the bible, say that you believe it is true, and yet not believe it. Believing in God is a verb. Believing in God will cause you to build arks, walk on water, walk around Jericho. You get the idea.

Dear ones, do you believe in The God of the Bible? Do you believe that He still does miracles amongst His people? Or did He close the book on miracles once the ink of Scripture was dried? When the disciple were astounded at the sight of the cursed fig tree, Jesus said to them, have faith in God. Wait a minute. Would Jesus have chosen men to be His disciple that did not believe in God? Absolutely not! But though they had a true belief in God, in this instance, they (like you and me), did not believe God.

To believe God means that we believe that He is Who He says He is, and that He says and means what He says and means. He is not the Great I used to be. The Great God Who used to draw water from rocks or used to heal the sick, or used to provide all of our need according to His riches in glory. The Lord Jehovah forever is The Sovereign, Almighty, Living God, in Whom we live and move and have our being. Believe Him today!

Do not resign yourself to a cold theology that has no life; explains away or "dispensationalizes" miracles. Surrender your total being to our God and Savior Jesus Christ Who said that He came to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.</ns3:encoded>

			<ns0:comment_content>Having spent four months with atheists and Catholics, I could relate to this morning's devotional. My atheist family does NOT believe in God, while my Catholic acquaintances believe IN God but when it comes down to it they do NOT believe God. What are clear markers? Constant worry, putting all worries on their shoulders, emphasis on their problem solving and not God's. Lots of cliches about their faith but failure to TRUST GOD, BELIEVE GOD. As Christians, We must seek Him first. Certainly, the temptation to worry and to put all burdens on myself is there. I am a sinner. But I catch myself during these times of weakness and reach for the Word, prayer, and allow the Holy Spirit to work within me. Then, as hard as it may be, I let go and believe God. Not because I am good or wise, but because HE IS. God bless Pastor Ray. Miss you all.</ns0:comment_content>

		<title>Receiving one another glorifies God</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Romans 15.5-7 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

God's will is that His children be likeminded towards one another. I take that to mean what we read elsewhere, Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant. As followers of Jesus Christ, we are called to receive one another in Christ, the same way that Christ has received us. As Jesus humbled Himself and became a servant. We too are to humble ourselves in the sight of God and serve one another.

Beloved, can I be honest with you? You would think Scripture said "reject and criticize one another for The glory of God." God has one word for all of us followers of Jesus with bad attitudes towards fellow believers. Repent! Our bad attitudes grieve God's Spirit. Our refusal to serve one another is flat out disobedience that quenches the love of God. It is only when we obediently submit to The Lordship and love of Jesus Christ that we will with one mind and one mouth glorify God. Look to the cross. Peek into that empty tomb. See Him ascending into heaven. Embrace His promise to return. Christ crucified. Christ risen. Christ ascended into heaven. Christ coming again! I said all of that without mentioning one denomination or creed, because Jesus is bigger than any denomination or creed. We magnify Jesus, not denominations. We magnify Jesus, not creeds. Consult Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4&amp;amp;5 for a refresher course on Who and what we are to magnify if need be.

May our prayers for one another go further than the walls of our churches and preferences or personal expressions of "credal" faith and worship styles. Receive one another as Christ has received you to the glory of God. Stop the spiritual trash talking saints. Oh magnify The Lord with me, and let us glorify His Name forever!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>God&amp;#039;s Unmerited Grace</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Exodus 17.6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.

The nation of Israel is grumbling and complaining at the providential dealings of God with them. First, they complained about the lack of food. Now they are ready to stone Moses because there is a lack of water. Okay, you are God; what do you do. All I can say is you can be glad that I am not God! Listen to how Jehovah so graciously deals with His grumbling, complaining and discontented people. Amazingly, God instructed Moses to strike not at the grumblers but at the Lord, Who is symbolized in Scripture as The Rock.

Deuteronomy 32.4 reads, The Rock, his work is perfect,for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He." Is that grace or what? God smites His Son to provide a blessing for His wayward children.

But therein is the gospel of Jesus Christ. When the judgment of God fell on The Lord through the rod of Moses, it resulted in rivers of water streaming out to give refreshment and life to sinners. When Gods wrath fell upon Christ on the cross of Calvary, The Holy Spirit, like rivers of living water flowed from heaven to give life to those who called upon His Name (John 7:37-39; Gal. 3:13-14). Let us never cease to marvel at the vastness and depth of Gods grace, that enables us to drink deeply of the streams of life that He has bought for us with His blood.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The beauty and cost of worship</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=1703</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>John 12.3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

The example of worship demonstrated by Mary here teaches us both the beauty and the cost of true worship. It is estimated that the container of ointment that Mary emptied to anoint Jesus feet was worth about a years wages, a large sum. That would be like giving a year's wages to your local church &lt;span class="aBn"&gt;&lt;span class="aQJ"&gt;next Sunday!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

But the worship of God is far more than financial, isn't it? Finances are indeed a part of worship, but God wants far more than our wallets; He is looking for our heart. All of our heart.

In Romans 12:1,2 we read, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."

Worship is a lifestyle that is committed to the will and purposes of God. It is a life of self denial and sacrifice. But it is also a life of great joy and blessing. In the world, you live and then you die. In the kingdom of God, you die before you live. Jesus is our example of this.

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."

Christ's death on the cross resulted in the giving of life to those who trust in Him. And what will be the response of those who trust in Jesus? "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour."

When we come to Christ, we die. But when we die, we live. The beauty of that "costly" way of living is that we will be with The Lord forever. Jim Elliott said, "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot lose."</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Great is Thy Faithfulness</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=1706</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 08:27:31 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator>smorse</dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.koinoniafellowship.com/rayviola/?p=1706</guid>
		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One of the most comforting and assuring attributes of God is His faithfulness. The Psalmist declared that Gods faithfulness reaches unto the clouds (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Psalm 36:5&lt;/span&gt;)! Nothing in the character of God is shady or to be held in doubt. The Scriptures simply declare that God is faithful (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1 Corinthians 1:9, 10:13&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;What are the practical implications of the fact that God is faithful? It means that He keeps His word. The character of God is reflected in His Word, and in His Word He has declared that all things are working together for good for those who love Him and are the called according to His purpose (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Romans 8:28&lt;/span&gt;). It also means that because God is faithful, He cannot lie (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Numbers 23:19; Titus 1:2&lt;/span&gt;). We can be absolutely sure that whatever God says in His Word, He will bring to pass&lt;span class="s2"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;All of His promises are true (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;2 Corinthians 1:20&lt;/span&gt;), all of His prophecies will come to pass (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Revelation 1:1&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;The Scriptures assure us that Gods faithfulness towards His children is great (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lamentations 3:22,23&lt;/span&gt;). Whenever we partake of The Lords Supper and we look at the elements representing the body and blood of Christ, we think of the words that Jesus spoke to His disciples in the upper room, Remember Me (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1 Corinthians 11:24,25&lt;/span&gt;). Not only do we remember the cost of grace in the sacrifice of Jesus (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Ephesians 1:7, 2:7&lt;/span&gt;), but we remember the faithfulness of God in bringing Christ into this world, just as He promised He would long ago (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Genesis 3:15; Isaiah 7:14&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Beloved, never doubt the faithfulness of God, for in essence that is calling Him a liar. Difficult times and crushing situations can overwhelm us. Hard times come to all of us (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Psalm 60:3&lt;/span&gt;). However, it is important for us to remember that the atonement of Christ does not immediately erase all of the effects and consequences of sin. That day is coming (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Revelation 21:3-5&lt;/span&gt;)! As we take the bread and the cup this morning, may we take them in complete confidence in Gods promise of eternal life through faith in Christ (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;1 John 2:25&lt;/span&gt;). Apart from faith in Christ, we have no hope of coming to The Father (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;John 14:6&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Reader, do you have that hope this morning (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Colossians 1:27; Titus 3:7&lt;/span&gt;)? Have you come to know The Living Christ as your portion (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Lamentations 3:24&lt;/span&gt;)? Trust Him today, for He is faithful to save you and keep you from falling (&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Jude 24,25&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>John 16.27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

Jesus spoke these words to His 11 disciples just hours before He would be tried, lashed and crucified. He wanted them to know that in spite of what would happen to Him and them, His Father loved them. His love for them was because they loved Jesus, and believed that He came from The Father. Dear ones, we are loved of The Father for the very same reasons. That is not to dismiss the many passages of Scripture that admonish us to walk in obedience and holiness as an indication that we belong to Jesus. But the very root of all that we do in our Christian life stems from the fact that we are loved by The Father with a perfect love.

This perfect love of The Father is not a legal kind of a love. It is a love that is rooted in the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ. As we once bore the consequences of being in Adam. We now enjoy the fruit of being in Christ. The relationship that we now have with God is a loving one, not one that is based on performance. It is that assurance, love and acceptance of The Fathers that inspires us to live our lives with hope and confidence. We now cry Abba Father to The One a Who sent His Son to die for our sins. We no longer need to be a slave of fear or worry, for He has given unto us the spirit of power, love and a sound mind. His perfect love casts out all fear. Nothing can ever separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Glory to God!

We all struggle with God's love for us. Especially when our circumstances are dark and gloomy. But there is only one manifestation spoken of in Scripture that proves God's love for us. That is the cross of Jesus on Calvary. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. Because we are freely loved by God, we can now freely love one another.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>How do you spell success?</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Joshua 1.8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

God is not opposed to us being successful, provided that our definition of success aligns with His Word and will. A person may be famous, wealthy and extremely intelligent and yet be a complete failure in the eyes of God. Herein is the key, dear ones. In whose eyes do you want to be a success? In the eyes of man, or in the eyes of God? To be a success in the eyes of man, you must often play according to the "ways of the world." To be a success in the eyes of God, you must seek to please only Him.

Please note that being a success in the eyes of God cannot be separated from being a person who reads, meditate so and applies the truth of God to every area of ones life. According to Psalm 1.1-3, to be a success in the eyes of God, you must do something's that are negative as well as meditate upon the things of God.

Beloved, God's perfect will for each one of us is to be a success. Not famous. Not wealthy. A success in the sense that our lives know of only one will to be done, and that one will is His. Do not believe the world's definition of success, for it is shortsighted, temporal and vain. Only those who love and live God for the will of God are a success in the eyes of God. May our gracious Father pour out His strong Spirit upon us today, in order that we, through the power of His might, might seek to live out the truth and precepts of God for His glory and honor. I guess I could sum up what it means to be a success in God's eyes this way. Seek to be faithful to Jesus in all that you do today.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Growing together in Christ</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Acts 2.41-47 &lt;em&gt;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles 'doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.&lt;/em&gt;

The pattern and practice of the early church lays the groundwork for the right kind of foundation for every church. Understanding and putting into practice the principles of this text are essential for us as a New Testament Church.

Last September, I shared with you the 4-fold vision statement of Koinonia Fellowship. The 4-fold vision statement is this:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;TO KNOW CHRIST- John 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;TO GROW IN CHRIST- 2Peter 3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;TO PROCLAIM CHRIST- Mark 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;TO BRING GLORY TO GOD- 1Cor 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This 4-fold vision statement is not original in the least. It is based on the great commission at the end of every gospel and the beginning of the book of Acts. It has been the engine that has driven all that we are about here at Koinonia. Before last September, I do not think that I ever presented this 4-fold statement in a study format as I did then and am doing now.

This 4-fold vision is the foundation that has inspired many saints to evangelize to the lost with the gospel locally and abroad. It has been the foundation that has inspired 4 other men go out and start local congregations. It has been the foundation of our efforts to make better and more disciples of Jesus Christ for the glory of God. You have seen a small portion of some of that fruit today in our praying for our wonderful teens who will be serving at FCWC this year, Lord willing.

Nearly every single week, I receive an email with an invitation to listen to this particular teaching series or buy this set of small group workbooks because it has unlocked the key to church growth and discipleship. Beloved, you cannot franchise Spirit born, Spirit desiring, Spirit filled fellowship or discipleship.

The most recent one that I got last Tuesday came attached with a pop up note that went along with the video presentation that said this: Hi I am ______are there any questions I can answer? Or, could I just tell you how awesome you are?

I was tempted to text the person and tell them, if you only knew how jerky I am thinking today, you would probably rescind the how awesome I am part of the offer!

I am amazed when I look around and see so many clonesof well-known mega churches. They even hold conferences that pass along these keys to growth and success. I believe that The Lord wants the overseers of each flock to look to Him for wisdom and guidance rather than try to duplicate these Spirit born congregations 'success story' by buying that set of books with the hopes of being a miniature imitation of that church themselves.

Not thinking through a strategy as a church for implementing this original church pattern is not an option, because no strategy is a strategy. And any failure to clearly communicate this to you precious people lies squarely upon the shoulders of the person speaking to you today, and I apologize for that. But today, I desire to clear the fog a bit.

When you come to the early church in the book of Acts and the epistles, you do not see a perfect church. Far from it. They had tons of problems. I was telling our Sunday night study group that I would like to put scaffolding around the church building from now until Jesus comes. Why? To remind ourselves and the world around us that every single person who calls this church their home are all under construction until He takes us home. Thanks for the patience!

I suggest to you that what you &lt;em&gt;do see happening&lt;/em&gt; in the book of Acts is not the result of a culture survey that indicated that something needed to be done to get people to evangelize or bring them together for fellowship.

What we see in the book of Acts is a Spirit born, Spirit driven, non-manufactured freshness in everything they were doing. Just like a newborn baby instinctively goes for their mothers breast for feeding, these saints craved the things of The Lord that were recorded for us in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2.42-47&lt;/strong&gt;.

The practices and disciplines that we read about here were The Spirit driven, Spirit inspired foundation for churches throughout the centuries.

We cannot duplicate the Jerusalem church or repeat that original Pentecost, but we can and should seek to prayerfully pattern our churches around these foundational practices.

What we learn Scriptures is that Christianity is a relational faith.

First it is vertical. We begin by having a relationship to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesians 2.18 For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Peter 3.18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and for ever. Amen&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 John 1.3,4 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Secondly, we are immediately brought into relationship with other believers, which are known as the church or called out ones.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesians 2.19-22 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hebrews 10.24,25 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The word that is most often used to describe this second aspect of relationship is 'fellowship'. It comes from a Greek word,&lt;em&gt; koinonia&lt;/em&gt; that basically means 'to share, to partner with, to contribute or to have in common'. John Stott points out that fellowship "expresses what we share together," and "what we share out together, what we give as well as what we receive" [&lt;em&gt;The Spirit, The Church, and The World&lt;/em&gt;, pp. 82-83].

Those who &lt;strong&gt;continued steadfastly&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Acts 2.42-47&lt;/strong&gt; were the same individuals that &lt;strong&gt;gladly received the word&lt;/strong&gt; and were saved in verse 41. Thus, they were born again.

It is my opinion thatwhen you have to constantly coax a professing Christian to find delight in the Lord and His Word; and you have to berate him to join in fellowshipping with God's people; and you have to virtually harass him to worship the Lord; the problem is not poor follow-up. The problem is no new birth.

The phrase &lt;strong&gt;continued steadfastly&lt;/strong&gt; carries the idea of &lt;em&gt;being devoted to&lt;/em&gt; teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer. And they did so steadfastly. What does steadfast mean? &lt;strong&gt;He stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51).&lt;/strong&gt; Jesus set His face steadfastly to go to the cross to die for our sins.

To continue steadfastly means that it was something that Jesus did deliberately, intentionally and willingly.

What if Jesus had done what I so often do? Well, Id like to go pray with the saints, but Ive go too much to do; or Id like to go to that home study or ladies group and fellowship with the saints but if I dont hit the gym I am going to look like a beached whale.

If Jesus had said, I think Im going to Jerusalem, or Id like to go to Jerusalem, or I hope to go to Jerusalem, you and I would fry in hell forever.

Something so distinctive, so radical, so new happened to these people who knew Jesus as Lord that they were constantly giving their attention learning &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. They began fellowshipping &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. They began breaking bread &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. They began praying &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. They began worshipping The Lord &lt;em&gt;together.&lt;/em&gt;

This word &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; is repeated many times in the many "one another" passages of the New Testament. We are to love one another...forgive each other...be kind to one another...accept one another...encourage one another...admonish one another...do good to one another...stimulate one another to love and good deeds...bear one another's burdens.

This brings us back to the importance of what the word Koinonia or fellowship means:

&lt;strong&gt;Fellowship&lt;/strong&gt;- Gr. &lt;em&gt;koinonia&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;sharing, contribution, participation, partnering, giving&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whenever we help one another financially, that's koinonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whenever we send one another a meal, or a card that's koinonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whenever we are given to hospitality, that's koinonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whenever we help one another out, that's koinonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whenever we use our gift to minister to one another, thats Koinonia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Koinonia is a verb. It is practical. Koinonia is motivated by the love of Jesus for me that is translated into a love for one another for the glory of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Growing together in Christ is simply the meeting of one another's needs in the Body. It is our partnering together to help each other live out the demands of the Christian life. It is the relationship of rejoicing with one another, weeping with one another, lifting up the fallen, coming to one another's aid, giving to one another, and sharing with one another out of the abundance of what the Lord is teaching us. It is the crux of Christian communication--one brother sharing with another brother the things of God and vice versa.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Growing together in Christ includes the entire body of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Growing together in Christ includes every local congregation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Growing together in Christ includes getting together with other saints in a smaller setting for fellowship, prayer and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Growing together in Christ includes inviting people into your life that you can be accountable to and confess your faults to. Accountability partner (in addition) to your spouse. (print out accountability questions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And I would dare to say to you, beloved, that biblical Koinonia this is far more than getting acquainted really well with 8 to 12 people in any growth group setting. If your thinking of growing together in Christ is limited to being a part of a particular group, you are thinking far too small.

I want Koinonia Fellowship to be a body of people who see themselves as investors and farmers in one anothers lives.

Growing together in Christ conveys this important thought: Each and every one of us are responsible before God to exercise my God given spiritual gifts, talents and resources to bless one another and glorify The Father.

Being a Christian in a local church has been like being a investor or a farmer. If you make no investment or deposit in a bank, how much of a withdrawal can you expect? Zippo

If you do not plant any seeds in the ground this spring, how many flowers or vegetables will you have this summer? Zippo.

Growing together in Christ is that 3 fold chord spoken of in &lt;strong&gt;Ecclesiastes 4.10&lt;/strong&gt; that is both vertical and horizontal. It is saints connected to and receiving from The Lord and in turn, investing and sowing those gifts on one another.

Every church with a building faces the challenge of resisting people's tendency to view the building as the church. The church is you and me.Thus, it is vital for every saint to have fellow Christians that they can grow together in Christ with regularly outside of the hurried hello, goodbye of Sunday morning.

So as I urge you today to connect with some group or consider starting one, let me urge you to take that one step further and make fellowship and discipleship a way of life. Choose to seek first the kingdom of God and are make it a point to live for the purpose of conforming to Christ and helping others conform to Christ.

Let me say in closing that the ultimate small group is the family.The Reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin said that teaching and discipleship begins in the home. John Calvin said "&lt;em&gt;Every family of the pious ought to be a church&lt;/em&gt;."

&lt;strong&gt;Current Growth Group Status&lt;/strong&gt;

Give status of participation in current groups. 170 out of around 500+ adults are connected on a weekly basis to one of our current growth groups.

It is virtually impossible to build deep friendships,accountability, or satisfying relationships through attending church services only. There are many people attending church services who feel lonely, isolated, and marginalized. Joining a small group gives people the ability to build friendships, be mentored in the faith, understand and discuss the truth of the Word, identify and use their spiritual gifts, and provide care for one another.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;How can you get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you would like to host a growth group. For any person who opens their home, you must have the gift of hospitality. That is one of the most vital ingredients for a fruitful growth group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you would like to open your home to facilitate a growth group or perhaps you would like to lead one, but cannot open your home. We will provide you with a list of questions for discussion.This is a more interactive kind of a group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps some of you would like to teach a home study. This is more of the traditional teaching followed by fellowship group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps you would like to join an already existing growth group. Check out the tables in the fellowship hall for specifics on each group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Perhaps your gift is to visit the sick, write cards or make calls to people are hurting or needy. We have a Care Group ministry here, an if you would like to get involved in that type of ministry, there are people who will chat with you downstairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>2 Kings 6:15-17  And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

Elisha the prophet was the nemesis of the king of Assyria. This hater of the people of God sought to wipe them out militarily, but the problem was that every time he planned some attack, God would reveal to Elisha both when and where it would take place. Naturally, the king was suspicious of his advisors and thought that one of them was a traitor. But he was told that the culprit was the Jewish prophet Elisha! Bent on killing him, the angry king sent a large army to the place where Elisha and his servant were staying. Elishas servant arose early one morning, only to see this incredible army surrounding the city with one purpose - to kill Elisha and no doubt him as well. He asks Elisha now what? It looks like our proverbial goose is cooked. Elisha then tells him, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And then Elisha prayed, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. All that Elishas servant saw was what the natural eye could see. But when God opened Elishas eyes, he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. He saw! He saw that there is a realm, a kingdom that is invisible, but more real than that evidenced by our five senses.

Beloved, you may be facing some very ominous matters today. There may be those who are plotting to harm you, or who are determined to make life miserable for you. There may be a medical or financial or vocational fear of some sort that is robbing you of peace. May the God of Elisha open your eyes to see that if God be for (you), who can be against (you)? (Romans 8:31) May your eyes be opened to the fact that God has sent forth ministering spirits your way this morning to minister for them who are the heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14). Best of all, your Great Shepherd, Jesus Christ is with you. Fear not dear one; walk by faith and not by sight. Like Elisha, his servant, and Moses, you can and will endure today as you fix your eyes on Him Who is invisible. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH  is everlasting strength: (Isaiah 26:3,4) Selah

		<title>Purity, not Promiscuity</title>

		<ns3:encoded>1 Timothy 4:12  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

Paul exhorted Timothy to be an example of the believer in purity. When he wrote to the church in Thessalonica where immorality and promiscuity were common and acceptable, he reminded them that God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. (1 Thessalonians 4:7) 

There is a Gnostic type of holiness that is as alive and well today as it was in the days of the early church. It is legalistic and unbiblical. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, (Touch not; taste not; handle not; Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men? Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh. (Colossians 2:20-23) 

This kind of holiness has nothing to do with purity. In fact, a person can be very rigid in his or her holiness belief system and at the same time be very promiscuous.

Beloved, we are living at a time where the very foundations of manhood and womanhood and gender and sexuality are being attacked, demanding that we re-examine the biblical call to purity. Any attempt to challenge these new standards results in accusations of being haters and old-fashioned. 

Dear reader, God says that our bodies are His temples to be used for His glory, and His tools for His service. Read with me 1 Corinthians 6:19,20: What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods. 

Now read Romans 12:1,2: I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. 

May The Holy Ghost empower each follower of Jesus to live an exemplary life of purity that reflects the very nature of Jesus in a fallen world that has lost its moral compass. Scripture, not society, is the foundation of what purity looks like in the sight of God.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>When Barnabas visited the church at Antioch, he saw the grace of God and was glad. (Acts 11:22,23)  Obviously, for the grace of God to be visible, their faith was alive and evidenced by good works.  Remember how the four men brought their hurting friend to Jesus?  The Bible speaking of this event says that Jesus saw their faith.    

True faith, living faith is one of substance.  Its an active verb, not simply a passive thought.  The object of our faith is God.  So, when we comprehend the grace of God, it will inspire a living faith in God.  This living faith allows us to follow the footsteps of the saints of old that trusted in the Lord.  Yes, the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.  This faith in Jesus gives us a boldness even in the face of lifes Goliaths!  Whenever we are choosing to believe in Jesus and not our conflicting feelings or thoughts, thats a living, walking faith.  

It is not a matter of if you have faith, because every child of God has been given a measure of faith.  This means the Lord measures enough faith to meet whatever the challenge.  No, the question is whether or not you will exercise your faith, as did the woman with a twelve year bleeding problem.  Remember also the spies who were defeated by doubt, not by the giants.  A living faith believes the promises of God against all odds.  

As we believe in Jesus, His mighty Spirit will stir us up to develop an ever increasing faith on a moment to moment basis.  This growing faith will enable you to be glad because you know that God has begun a work in you, and Hes not about to quit!</ns3:encoded>

1 Peter 1:18-21  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

Everything that Jesus Christ did in His atoning sacrifice was done for us. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Jesus perfectly fulfilled the law of God for us. Jesus defeated the devil and every evil principality and power of darkness for us. All that He did was in perfect submission to the eternal will and purpose of God. Once a sinner places faith in Jesus Christ as the only means of being forgiven, and thus brought into fellowship with God, they become the recipients of every benefit of the atonement of Jesus. We are no longer dead in trespasses and sins in Adam; we are complete and alive in Christ. Too many of Gods people have an in Christ theology, but live out their lives with an in Adam mentality.

As we approach The Lords table this morning, we are exhorted by Jesus to remember Him as we drink the cup and eat the bread (Luke 22:19). Too often we forget what we should remember, and in the process, find ourselves under the law and bound by the lies of the devil. We do not deny the reality of sins consequences, or the daily battle against the world, the flesh and the devil. But praise be unto God that by grace, through faith in His Son Jesus Christ, we no longer fight for victory, but from victory, which has been given to us by Jesus Christ, The Lamb of God!!

		<ns3:encoded>1 Timothy 5:22  keep thyself pure.

Those words were spoken by the apostle Paul to Timothy, his son in the faith of Jesus Christ. The word pure means to be innocent, clean, holy, sincere, free of defilement or impurity. Jesus tells us that the source of defilement or impurity stems from the iniquity that dwells in our heart. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: (Matthew 15:18,19). The context here in the gospel is a conversation between Jesus and the legalistic, letter-of-the-law religionists of the day, who thought that because they observed the ritual of washing their hands before dinner, they were pure. What Jesus was telling them (and us this morning) is that observing outward rules and regulations cannot produce purity. What they needed was a new heart.

Once we come to saving faith in Jesus Christ, which is called the new birth, we are given a new heart. The heart in Scripture is not the biological organ that pumps blood through our system. It is the regenerating work of Gods Spirit in the deepest part of our being. It gives birth to a brand new way of living and thinking. Having been given a new heart by faith in Jesus Christ, we (like Timothy) are now responsible to keep ourselves pure. Being pure does indeed require mental discipline, for the world we live in is anything but pure. That is why we need to heed Pauls exhortation to the Philippian church: Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. (Philippians 4:8) 

But what I want you to think about this morning, beloved, is this. When you think of purity, the natural inclination is to think of what is or isnt pure, and that is indeed an important part of what keeping ourselves pure requires. But my question is, who is our example of walking in purity? Jesus Christ. But what group of people annoyed and grieved His pure heart? The self-righteous, rule-keeping, judgmental, outwardly religious Pharisees. 

When Jesus taught the multitudes how not to pray (Luke 18:9-14), or how not to give, or how not to fast, He used the self-righteous, holier-than-thou, critical-of-all-others Pharisees as examples. Thus, one sure way to keep yourself pure is to listen to what Jesus said about the Pharisees and purpose to model your Christian walk after the example of Jesus Christ. Walk in close fellowship with The Father. Do what He tells you to do and say what He tells you to say. Be moved with compassion for the multitudes. Live out the great commandment practically (Matthew 22:36-39). It doesnt get any purer than that! Expect this living pure like Jesus to be questioned and disturb the denomination of the Pharisees, which is as alive and well today as it was then. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Jesus The Redeemer and Revealer of The Father</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>John 1:18 (NLT)  No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God,... has revealed God to us.

An interesting revelation is found by studying the life of Jesus as it is given to us in the four gospels. When we read the gospels there is a tendency to only teach that Jesus came to redeem man from their debt of sin. Praise God for the forgiveness of sin that we have, by grace, through faith in Jesus. But what is often overlooked is that Jesus also came to reveal The Father, and in doing so, He gives us an example of how to manifest Him in and through our lives today. The way that Jesus dealt with prostitutes, the crooked tax collectors, the drunkards, and so on and so forth teaches us that you can display the love of God, the grace of God, the goodness of God, and the mercy of God without tolerating or condoning sin or condemning the sinner.

Does it amaze you that sinners wanted to be with Jesus? People like Zaccheus, the cheating tax collector (Luke 19), adulterous women (John 4 &amp; 8), and demon-possessed individuals (Luke 8). The orthodox religious leaders of the day were offended because of who associated with Jesus and how He dealt with sinners. They were offended because they only had an academic, head knowledge of Scripture, but they had no clue of the true character and nature of The Father. They were constantly offended by the kind of people that Jesus chose to be His apostles, and they were stumbled by the kind of people that heard Him teach and decided to follow Him. The religious leaders considered the deeds and teachings of Jesus too unacceptable and far removed from the god that they created in their own image and likeness. Truth be told, beloved, how Jesus lived was a perfect expression of the nature and character of God The Father. How do we know that? Because Jesus said, ... He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (John 14:9).

And Who is it that redeemed us and calls us to follow Him? Jesus. Jesus said, come to Me (Matthew 11:28), follow Me (Luke 9:23), and learn of Me (Matthew 11:29). Followers of Jesus will never take or tolerate sin in themselves or others lightly. Nonetheless, their lives will always seek to demonstrate the redeeming and Christ-like example of the kindness, love, mercy, and love of God to a lost and dying world that needs to hear the glorious gospel and see the life of Jesus manifested in the lives of those who call Him Lord and Savior.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Whats in Your Heart?</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Isaiah 29:13  Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:

When the prophet Samuel went to the house of Jesse to anoint the successor for king Saul, God told Samuel, the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. (1 Samuel 16:7) Religion places an emphasis on the outward appearances, but God places the emphasis on the heart, the attitudes, the motives. The Pharisees were a religious group that zealously separated themselves to keep their manmade and unbiblical traditions. They upheld their oral traditions above the teachings of Scripture. On the outside, they were very impressive. They zealously prayed, fasted, tithed, observed the Sabbath and holy days. But Jesus called them hypocrites  actors, a false representation of true religion (Mark 7:1-13). In fact, in Luke 18:9-14, one of these men was in the temple praying (NOT!) and telling God how holy and righteous he was compared to the despicable and unclean publican. He could not be more deceived. Read the story. These religious frauds said the right things and even did the right things, but their heart was far from God.

Before we point a finger of judgment at these religious frauds or anyone else this morning, let me ask you a few very pointed questions. Are you more impressed with keeping up a good show on the outside, while inwardly you are filled with a critical, self-righteous disposition towards others who do not outwardly meet your religious standards? When we worship The Lord, are your lips saying the right things, but is your heart a million miles away, or critiquing the way others are worshipping? Beloved, God is far more concerned with what is going on in your heart, than how high you lift your hands during worship. Scripture says that we do not even know what is going on in our own hearts, let alone someone elses (Jeremiah 17:9). Beware of being guilty of judging Another Mans servant (Romans 14:4). The Spirit of God will not conform you into the image of a judgmental, critical, holier-than-thou Pharisee, but into the image of Jesus Christ. Think about the people who gave Jesus the hardest time during his ministry. There is nothing new under the sun. Beware of becoming a follower of contemporary Christianity, which is a form of godliness on the outside, but void of the life, grace, love, and mercy of Jesus on the inside. What Spirit is in your heart this morning, beloved?</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Olivet Discourse</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Matthew 24:3a  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?

     Over the years, it has never ceased to amaze me how God has coincidentally timed our studies in Scripture. Such is true of our study this morning. We are in Mark 13, and it begins this way: And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. What a shocker those words of Jesus must have been for the disciples. But after He tells them about the destruction of the temple, Matthew adds this question: And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? (Matthew 24:3b) So Jesus is going to prophesy in this chapter the destruction of the temple and, secondly, the signs of His coming and the end of the age. Within 40 years, the prophecy of Jesus Christ regarding the destruction of the temple was fulfilled just the way He said it would happen. Likewise, the signs of His coming and the end of the age will take place just as Jesus said they would.

      Did you know that there are more prophecies of the second coming of Jesus Christ and the last days than prophecies regarding His first coming? In other words, the eternal plans and purposes of God are going to happen and nothing is going to stop them. No evil scheme of the devil or conspiracy of man is going to stop the coming of The Lord. No pestilence or natural disasters are going to stop the coming of The Lord. It is sad when the lives of the people of God are more preoccupied with and wrapped up in the current crisis and pandemics and conspiracy theories than with Gods Word.

     A word that Jesus repeats in His end of the world discourse is watch (Mark 13:33,35,37). It is in the present imperative tense. This means that our lives are to be shaped by the constant anticipation of Jesus. The only appropriate response to darkness is to preach the gospel, not draw more attention to the darkness. In Revelation 22:7 Jesus said, Behold I come quickly. Jesus is coming soon. Those were His last words in Scripture. His final words before His ascension were to go into the entire world and preach the gospel (Mark 16:15,19). Beware of living your life in constant reaction to the evil deeds of darkness. Like the wise virgins, be filled with The Spirit (Matthew 25:1-13) and be about your Fathers business of proclaiming the Good News of Jesus Christs soon return. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. (Revelation 22:12) Selah

		<ns3:encoded>Psalm 128:1  Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

 The bible asks in Psalm 11:3, If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? Satan may be a liar and a deceiver, but one thing that he is not.stupid! He can read, and even he knows what happens when Gods order is denied. The prince of the power of the airs one mission and agenda on planet earth is to destroy, disrupt, or dispute any God-ordained source of order and authority. Whenever and wherever God-ordained order or authority is destroyed, disrupted, or disputed, chaos and confusion set in and all hell breaks loose. Theres no mistaking the fact that the order God established in the home is under siege in our society.  

     Therefore, today, I am giving a clarion call to every Christian father, grandfather, and great-grandfather to be a God-fearing, Christ-exalting, Spirit-filled man of God, and rise up to take your God-ordained place as head of your home. As we look at the 128th Psalm this morning, may each father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and husband hear and heed the promises that are given to men who fear The Lord and walk in His ways. The task is daunting, brothers. The need is critical. May we stare down the spirit of this age and, by the grace and power of God, rise up and be the God-fearing head, husband, father, and grandfather that God has called us to be for His glory and honor. Selah

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage contrasts the attitudes and outcomes of the wicked and the righteous in various aspects of life, such as management of finances, speech, friendship, and justice. The wicked rely on their own resources, express their folly, isolate themselves, and face ruin. The wise seek understanding, find refuge in God, have faithful friends, and receive honor. Please open your Bible to Proverbs eighteen, verse eleven, and listen as Pastor Ray Viola completes his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span data-sheets-root="1"&gt;Todays passage teaches us the value of godly character which is marked by integrity, patience, discipline, and a forgiving heart. In contrast, there are harsh consequences for folly or godlessness. We will also see that the benefits of wealth are fleeting, but truthfulness and understanding have enduring value. Please open your Bible to Proverbs nineteen, and follow along as Pastor Ray Viola begins his study of this chapter.&lt;/span&gt;

		<title>Blessed Are The Poor In Spirit</title>

		<ns3:encoded>The Beatitudes are a description of a disciple of The Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:3-12). They are a description of Christian character which is the fruit of abiding in Jesus Christ (John 15:1-16). As we ponder this list, it does not take long to discover that Gods Whos Who list is vastly different from the worlds!

The foundation of all the other beatitudes is that of being poor in spirit. The Greek word for poor here means to crouch over. Strongs Concordance tells us that it describes a beggar (as cringing), i.e. pauper. Although it is a word commonly used to describe people who are financially destitute and bankrupt, the word also applies to the realm of ones soul or spirit in comparison with the perfections of a holy God. As long as we compare ourselves with ourselves, we can always find someone, somewhere that we are better than in some way, shape or form. But, when you and I see ourselves in the light of Gods perfect holiness and majesty, we realize we are blind, wretched, naked and poor (Revelation 3:17).

The Sacred Scriptures do not Amen the secular doctrine of humanism and human potential apart from the grace and Spirit of God. The record of Scripture declares that there is none righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10). The Holy Spirit provides for us a spiritual CAT scan of mankind with a diagnosis that staggers our minds and blows our ego out of the universe (Romans 1:22-32, 3:11-18). If the Scriptures did not declare it, I would not believe that I was born into this world an ungodly enemy of God (Romans 5:6,8,10). If the Scriptures did not declare it to be so, I would not think that I needed to be born again of The Spirit of God if I intended to see or enter the kingdom of God (John 3:3-8). I am naturally more in agreement with that Pharisee in the temple than with the lowly publican (Luke 18:9-14).

By Gods grace, I am able to see my wretched condition (Romans 7:24). This awareness of who I really am in the sight of God leaves me broken (Psalm 34:18, 51:17). But it doesnt leave me without any hope, because God in His marvelous grace has provided a solution to my sin debt and lifestyle of sin problem, and that solution is the gospel of Jesus Christ (Romans 1:16,17). Through faith in Christ, all of my sin is forgiven (Ephesians 1:7) and I am born again (1 Peter 1:18-23). Yes, I still sin and have need of continual forgiveness from God (1 John 1:7-10), but now I am a new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17).

The holiness of God leaves me spiritually bankrupt. The love of God leaves me speechless. The grace of God bids me to come and find rest for my soul (Matthew 11:28-30). Heaven only awaits those who are poor in spirit (Matthew 5:3). Is that you?

		<title>Mourning, The Path To Divine Comfort</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=44</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 09:45:33 +0000</pubDate>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>To the natural man, the words mourning and comfort do not even belong in the same library. But the Scriptures tell us they belong together.

Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. (1 Corinthians 2:14). Beloved, as far this fallen world system is concerned, everythingthat pertains to the kingdom of God or the gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness (1 Corinthians 1:18-31). Let me take that statement one step further. Apart from the divine illumination of The Spirit of God, neither you nor I would believe that mourning is the path to comfort! I mean, how comforting can it be to mourn? The answer to that question, of course, lies in Gods definition of the meaning of the word mourn. The mourning that is comforted is the result of my seeing theravaging effects of sin and calling upon God for mercy and grace (Psalm 32:1-4;Hebrews 4:14-16).

After The Spirit of God (John 16:7-9) brings me to that place of being poor in spirit (Matthew 5:3; Psalm 34:18), and I see my need for Gods grace through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9; Galatians 3:26) to forgive me for my sin, I begin to see sin for what it really is. Sin is a scourge that is the cause of every ill on planet earth. It is the root cause of every war, disease and calamity known to man. Adams one act of questioning God has placed all of mankind in a fatal spiritual condition. When The Spirit of God quickens us to see that condition and the consequences of sin, we begin to mourn. I mourn over how my sin has offended my God and King (Psalm 51:4). I mourn over how my sin has affected my family, my parents, my brothers and sisters in Christ.

Sin is a monster! It causes monstrous problems in relationships even within the church. Thus, when we believe the gospel (1 Corinthians 15:1-4) and God gives us new life (Ephesians 1:13-14), we no longer see life the way we did before we were saved. We mourn over sin and how it causes racism and the breakdown of families. We mourn over world events and the damage of natural disasters and wars that are brought about by sin.

The only answer to mourning for sin in my life and in the world is the gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ. Only Jesus can give comfort to sinners, because only Christ can forgive sin and the guilt and condemnation associated with it (Romans 8:1,2). Beloved, the gospel of Jesus Christ is the only source of comfort and hope for sinners to be saved in this world and for the world to come (Colossians 1:3-6).

		<title>On Sunday Morning. Be the church, just don't go there.</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;"&gt;Hebrews 10.24-25 reads: And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;"&gt;Today is the day that we, the church, gather together to worship Our God, hear from His Word, and pour into others what The Lord has poured into us all week. The people who just " go to church" miss the blessing that God promises for those who gather together in His Name. You see, in reality, the church goes to meet in building, thus we never really " go to church", for in reality, we are the church.&lt;/span&gt;

Here are a few things to ponder as you make your way to church today. Beloved church family, make it a point to set your heart and eyes on Christ today and bless Him in word and deed. When the worship begins, forget about others; adore Him and tell Him how much you love Him. Think about His great love and sacrifice for your sin as you lift your voice and hands unto Him. Pray for the pastor and all other teachers as the sermon is going forth. Ask The Holy Spirit to open hearts, comfort or convict as The Word is going forth. Pray for other churches in our community.

Consider the people around you. They are not there by accident, but by providence. Pray for them quietly, and then and ask God to open doors for you to minister to them in some way after the service or during the week with a call, email or visit. Exhort them in the things of The Lord.

Look for opportunities to serve The Lord in some way. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a visitor. Reach out to them and welcome them in The Name of Jesus. Take them around your facility and make them feel at home by helping them in any way you can. As you are leaving the premises, pray for those leaving along with you, and for those coming to the next service, if that is the case.

Follow up during the week with prayer for your church leadership, the various servants and your brothers and sisters in Christ.

Above all things, do everything that you do out of a deep love for Jesus Christ and the glory of His Father. Determine to be a blessing today beloved for the glory of God, and you will be blessed indeed!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Seeking God</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>When God told Jacob to go to Bethel to seek Him, the first thing that we read in Scripture is Jacob commanding his household to put away all strange gods, be clean and change your garments. In other words, if God is to be sought effectively, we must repent of any and all things that occupy that place in our hearts that belongs to God alone. &lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jacob-burying-the-strange-gods.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-459" alt="jacob-burying-the-strange-gods" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jacob-burying-the-strange-gods-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The Psalmist asked God to "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting." James tells us "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Today is a new day, and God's mercies are new every morning."

Precious child of God, seek The Lord today with an open and honest heart. Allow God's Spirit to lead you in prayer and confession of sin. Repentance is a part of the ongoing process of sanctification. He is faithful to cleanse you of all unrighteousness. Don't allow your sin and failure to cause you to run from Jesus, run to Him boldly. Gen 35.1,2; Psa 139.23,24; James 4.8; Heb 4.14-16</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Gospel Is Not Good Advice, It's Good News!</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Hebrews 9:11-12 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.

The gospel according to Hebrews is that Jesus Christ has tasted death for every man (Hebrews 2:9). And, having tasted death, according to the will of God, Jesus has wrought a perfect redemption and the gift of life everlasting. The devil once had the power of death, but Jesus Christ, by dying and rising again from the dead has stripped him of the ability to hold mankind in his grip of fear (Hebrews 2:14-15). Jesus became flesh and blood to accomplish the eternal redemptive purpose of His Father. But by becoming man, He experienced our human pains and sorrows and is able to help us in those times of need (Hebrews 4:15,16).

The Lord's Supper is a covenant meal of remembrance. It reminds us of the incredible grace of God that has been extended towards us through faith in His Son Jesus Christ. Being a child of God is not an accomplishment or achievement. It is an unmerited, undeserved gift. The gospel is not good advice (something that is given); it is good news (something that is done). Beloved, It IS Finished (John 19:30)!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Redemption: The Heart of the Gospel</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=6533</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>In Romans 5 verse 8, Paul writes that the love of God is being demonstrated for us in that while we are yet, or still sinners, Jesus Christ died for us.

Charles Spurgeon wrote: &lt;em&gt;The heart of the gospel is redemption, and the essence of redemption is the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, both the heart and essence of our redemption is our Redeemer Jesus Christ. But look at verse 8 once again. God demonstrates his own love toward us. Present tense. Ongoing action. It is not that God showed His love for us 2,000 years ago, which of course He did! Thats past. Thats history. That is fixed, objective, unchanging.

The idea here is that God commends His love &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; through the past, historical, objective fact of the death of his Son for us. The past tense, died conveys the fact that the death of Jesus Christ happened once and for all and will not be repeated. The Apostle Peter wrote that Christ died for sins &lt;em&gt;once for all,&lt;/em&gt; the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God (1 Peter 3:18)&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; And what was the purpose of Jesus, the Just One, dying for unjust sinners like myself? That He might bring us to God! Being brought to The Father through Jesus Christ is the Mount Everest of our salvation. We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom we have now received the atonement.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Healing Touch of Jesus</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 5:34  And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.

I love to read the gospels and see how Jesus ministered His healing touch to those who were in humanly impossible situations. As we move ahead in our journey through Mark's gospel (Mark 5:21-43), we come to the place where Jesus is met by the ruler of a synagogue by the name of Jairus, whose twelve year old daughter is at deaths door. He asks Jesus to come to his house and heal his daughter. On the way to his house, Jesus is thronged by a multitude. Amidst this great crowd is a woman with a critical internal bleeding problem. She has gone to doctors for help for twelve years, but to no avail. Because of this bleeding condition, she was considered unclean and was ostracized from society. She was at her wit's end. Can anyone relate to her? Presumably having heard of His power to heal, she determined that she was going to touch Jesus, assured, like Jairus was, that just by His touch she would be made whole. And she was right!

The very moment that this woman was miraculously healed by Jesus and told to go in peace, a contingency from Jairus house told him that there was no sense for Jesus to come to his house now because his daughter was dead. Immediately Jesus said to him, Do not be afraid: only believe. (v.36) Arriving at the house, they are met with a crowd that is mourning over the little girls death. Jesus then is laughed to scorn because He declares that she is not dead but asleep. After removing the scoffers, Jesus raises this precious little girl from the dead.

Are you or any of your loved ones in a dire situation this morning? Lets unite in prayer that the same healing touch of Jesus will come upon all those who are in humanly impossible situations. Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>How To Grow In Grace And Maturity</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Proverbs 9:7-9 He who corrects a scoffer gets shame for himself, And he who rebukes a wicked man only harms himself. Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

One of the ways that we can measure our growth in grace and spiritual maturity is discovered by the way we receive correction. The proverbs tell us that when we are corrected, we either respond in love, or react in anger. When we respond in love, we grow. When we react in anger, we only harm ourselves. When we respond in love, our fellowship with others deepens, as we learned from what happened after Paul rebuked Peter. When we react in anger and lash out in self defense, not only do we harm ourselves, but we alienate ourselves from others. Every one of us is in need of correction from time to time. No exceptions. It is by receiving correction that we grow in The Lord and fellowship with one another.

At the root of reacting to correction in the flesh is pride. Pride is that fleshly entity that rejects any notion of the need to be corrected or change our way of thinking. Pride sees the "corrector" as someone who hates them or is out to get them. Granted, there are people like that, but they are not Spirit-filled, nor do they reflect the image of Jesus. God's Word is filled with correction, rebuke, and instruction. If we are prone to react to correction from one another, are we really allowing God's Word to correct us? Obeying Jesus is a wise thing to do (Matthew 7:24-27). Disobeying Him is disaster. One of the ways Jesus corrects us is through another person. When "the least of these My brethren" (Matthew 25:40) corrects you, do you react or respond?</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Don't Live For Yourself</title>

		<ns3:encoded>The saddest person, the loneliest person, the most unfulfilled person is theindividual whose life orbits around one thing - self. How empty, how sad. To live for the pleasure of self is an indication that one is truly dead. The only way to be freed of self is through the cross of Jesus Christ. That is where your perspective of life and purpose for life change. Whereas you formerly lived on a purelyphysically-focused and self-fulfilling plane, you are now free to live for God's pleasure. Having the mind of Christ through rebirth, we now can look out for the interests of others.

Our example, Jesus, lived to always please the Father, not Himself. Only when we live to please God can we find true peace, joy and strength. Paul prayed that we might "walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing". As we yield ourselves to the Lord and meekly receive His engrafted word, the net result is God working in us that which is well pleasing in His sight. However, those who live for the flesh cannot please God.

How glorious to have a blessed confidence that Jesus is working in my life. He provides the victory over self by giving me many opportunities to serve Him with the ability that He supplies. Although every and any Spirit-filled believer will have their share of tribulation and suffering, they are rarely depressed for long periods of time because they are living for their Lord and others.

To seek the profit of others brings true prosperity. The Dead Sea is deadbecause there is an inflow of water but no outflow. That symbolizes the self. In contrast, be like the Jordan River. Take the things that God gives to you and has blessed you with, and then lovingly and sacrificially impart such things toothers. That's how we break out of the prison of self.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>That None Should Perish</title>

		<ns3:encoded>That none should perish but have everlasting life is the perfect will of God.Of course, this does not mean that none will perish for the twentieth chapter ofRevelation tells us otherwise. There we read that "anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire."

Do you recall the men and women Paul mentioned in Philippians as hisfellow workers in the gospel? Their names were written in the Book of Life, and they were well aware of it long before they died. How did they get their names in that Book? They, like Paul, embraced the righteousness that God provided for them through Jesus Christ and rejected any notion of earning their salvation.

The Father has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Over and over, Jehovah cries out to mankind to turn from their sin. He tells them that unless they repent, they will die in their iniquity. It is sad that people would choose to suffer eternally because they prefer to "enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season", but it is a choice, and there is a way out.

God has provided an escape for mankind and it is found in repenting from your sin and turning your life over to Jesus Christ. God has done all that is required to settle your debt of sin. All that is required of you is to call upon the name of Jesus Christ. The work is complete. and it is all of grace.

Reader, you have an appointment with the True and Living God. How will you answer for yourself? Will you claim to be a good person? Scripture says, "There is none righteous, no, not one". Will you plead ignorance? That won't cut it either: "For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse". Will you seek to enter heaven some other way? Jesus insisted there is no other way.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only cure for sin. Where you spend eternity is your choice. God does not want you to perish. That's the truth. The question is, do you believe it?

I beseech you today, right now, be reconciled to God. Respond to Jesus; don't ignore His knock. Simply enter into the family of God by faith in Him.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Jesus Cares For You</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>God told His people Israel that He would gather them from the Euphrates River to the brook of Egypt one by one. Those words "one by one" reveal the personal love and attention that God displays toward His people, not just as a nation, but as individuals.

One of the devil's most effective lies is that God is disinterested in us. Quite the contrary! Psalm is actually everyone's personal psalm because it reveals the depth of God's care for me and His creation of me. He knows my every move. In fact, God is always thinking precious thoughts about me. This same God, who knows me so well, died on a cross made of wood He created, so that I could have fellowship with Him.

Jesus cares for you and me personally, but it's so easy to get "lost in the crowd" so to speak, and forget that truth. Every one of our very hairs are numbered by Him. Who else would pay such attention to us that every time we brushed our hair or took a shower, they would subtract the hairs from the previous total? God cares for us! Believe it, because it's true. It's true even if you don't believe it.

Just as God chose the nation Israel for a unique purpose in His redemptive plan yet cared for them one by one, you and I in this mystery body called "the Church" are saved one by one. The Lord throughout His word unlocks the precious truth about His love and care for us. Read, for example, Jeremiah :: "Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, with lovingkindness I have drawn you." Note all of the personal pronouns in the psalms. Think about the "whosoevers" in the Scriptures; for example: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." You and I can draw fresh encouragement from God's word each and every day.

Just like the good Samaritan took care of the wounded, beaten and bruisedtraveler, Jesus Christ takes care of us. We, like Jesus, should reflect that same care for each other. In fact, that care that you and I receive from one another is nothing other than the operation of God in our hearts. To Him be the glory!

Personalize your Bible. Yes, there are the historical and theological truths that are vitally important, but never forget that God's word is God's message of hope, love, peace, forgiveness and comfort - for you! "Search from the book of the LORD, and read"!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Dealing With Self-Righteousness</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Romans 2:1-3 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou thatjudgest doest the same things. But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

James 2:10,11 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

Self righteousness runs deep in every human being. It is the fig leaf that condemns others for the same sins and failure that we too are guilty of. You may scream to me in protest, no way Pastor Ray! I am no thief! I am not a liar! I am no fornicator or drunkard! That may very well be true. But as we follow the logic of both Paul and James, we must realize that to disobey God in any way makes us guilty of total disobedience. Truth be told, the teaching of Jesus about the parable of the two men in the temple (Luke 18:10-14) is a revelation of the self righteousness that every one of us is guilty of. We scream out, I fast, I tithe, I go to prayer meetings; I don't watch television or listen to secular music. That may be so.

Have you ever bragged or boasted about your ability to sing, build something, teach a bible study? Have you ever had a flash thought of lust or jealousy? Have you ever despised another person for one reason or another? How are you doing with that teaching on forgiving others from Matthew 18:21-35? Many of God's people smugly read about the sexual perversion in Romans 1, but fail to read the other blistering sins of human depravity. Let's take a look, shall we? Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful. (Romans 1:29-31) Do you know who The Holy Spirit is talking about? The man or woman in the mirror.

When the glory and grace of God enters our souls, it drives the nails of crucifixion to self righteousness, and gives birth to a biblical understanding of how to deal with sin and conflict with others. A recipient of grace and mercy will be gracious and merciful. The plank in my eyes teaches me to be understanding of the speck in yours. Churches are split and relationships are severed over this matter. It's self righteousness. It's the flesh not getting what it thinks it deserves. Do we really want God to give us what we deserve? I think not. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. (Ephesians 4:30-32) Selah</ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Living God</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Thirty times in Scripture, God reveals Himself as "the living God". Fifteen times, in fact, in each Testament. When He uses the word "living" to describe Himself, He is conveying to us that He is active in the present tense or, simply put, "I AM." He is actively full of grace, love, mercy, and truth. He's always there when we need Him. He will never fail us. Our living God seals those that belong to Him. That means that once we trust in Jesus Christ for our salvation, we become the property of the living God. We are born by the Spirit of the living God and forever His!

How sad to see what unregenerate man worships or relies upon. "Wise"Solomon informs us that to live for anything other than the Lord is vanity.

Collectively we, as His Church, are to be "the pillar and ground of the truth" that the living God has revealed to us. But, it's having a personal relationship with Jesus our Savior that inspires each of us to lovingly labor and suffer reproach. However, we must guard our heart from something far more lethal than cholesterol, namely, the unbelief that causes us to depart from the living God.

Wealthy people are cautioned not to trust in their uncertain riches but in a very certain living God. When Israel was facing the challenge of conquering the Promised Land, Joshua told them that they did not need to fear their adversaries, but could rely upon the greatness of the living God among them. David said that Goliath should not get away with defying the armies of the living God.

The living God is my God, and I understand why David's soul got so thirsty for Him. It is good that we cry out now to the living God for His favor because the world will have to face the wrath of this living God one day. Reader, heed the gospel's call and escape this wrath. Never doubt the Lord's ability to deliver you when you feel "caged in". The kingdom of the living God is forever. It is indestructible.

"Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!' And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: `Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!'"</ns3:encoded>

Matthew 13:54-58  And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

     At the start of His public ministry, Jesus declared that He was the Christ, and that He came to fulfill the prophecies regarding Him (Luke 4:16-21). He was rejected (Luke 4:28-29). Now, as He is drawing towards the latter part of His earthly ministry, Jesus returns to the synagogue in Nazareth, only to be rejected again. The first time, Jesus went alone, He had no followers. This time He brought His disciples with Him. They heard the crowd question the nature of His birth. They could not deny the wisdom and power of Gods Spirit upon Him. But, as far as they knew, He was a carpenter with no rabbinical or theological training. Where then did He get such gifting? There were only two options: God or Satan. Amazingly, even His brothers and sisters did not know who He was. But Mark tells us that His disciples followed Him. He was teaching them both by precept and example that following Him at times includes being rejected, in spite of being in the center of Gods will and calling.

     To follow Jesus means that He is The One we look to for a perfect example of what the will of God looks like, on earth, as it is in heaven. When He sent them out with the authority to anoint with oil and cast out devils, they were learning that the power of God is released in His Name, even when He is not present physically. Whenever Jesus is praying, teaching, washing feet, or ministering to the multitudes, He is providing us the example that we are to follow. The apostle Paul told the Corinthians to follow him as he followed Christ (1 Corinthians 11:1).

     Beloved, we are first and foremost followers of Jesus; we have been bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20). Christ has purchased us for His glory. Our assignment here on earth is to re-present the life of Jesus in everything that we do. May God grant us the grace to remember that we live to follow and please only One, and His Name is Jesus. Follow Him.</ns3:encoded>

	As we break bread this morning, may we once again focus on Gods sole provision for mankinds sin, and that is His Son, Jesus Christ.  It is through Jesus Christ alone that the door of salvation into heaven is found.  

	Throughout Scripture we find this theme of atonement at the expense of another.  Psalm 22:1-18 and Isaiah 53:3-12 refer to a human being as the substitute, who is none other than our Passover Lamb, Jesus Christ.  Calvary magnifies the grace of God, and eliminates any human effort as the cause of our forgiveness of sin.  Grace eliminates works.  Grace will indeed produce works, but never can it be said that a persons works saved them.  Its all of grace!  

	Note however who this grace is offered to - the ungodly, sinners, enemies of God; in other words, whosoever wills.  Have you truly repented of your sin and committed your heart to the Lordship of Jesus Christ?  Allow Gods Holy Spirit to examine the very depths of your soul in preparation for todays communion observance.  May nothing keep you from Gods wonderful gift of eternal life.  Child of God, allow nothing to come between you and your loving Lord.  Look to Jesus today, and know that He loves you.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>Mark 7:15  There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.

The apostle Paul wrote to the church of Corinth these sobering words of warning regarding defiling the temple of God. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. (1 Corinthians 3:16,17) The religious teaching of the day was that the body was defiled by what we ate or drank, or by eating with unwashed hands. The Lord Jesus said, There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. (Mark 7:15) That was a radical statement. Jesus said that what we eat or drink only goes into our stomach and then is flushed down the toilet! Those kinds of things do not defile a person morally or spiritually. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. (Romans 14:17)

Jesus went on to say that what defiles the temple of God is the sin from within our very own hearts (Mark 7:20-23). And one of the indicators of the sin in our heart are the words that come out of our mouth (Matthew 15:11,18). As in His sermon on the mount, Jesus once again cites that the problems we face in society, in our families, and in the church all stem from the sin from within. And the part of the body that is most defiling and causes the most trouble is the human tongue. James 3 tells us that the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity (v6). Proverbs tells us that sowing discord among the brethren is an abomination (6:16,19). Sowing discord is just as disgusting as is sexual immorality and shedding of innocent blood. When is the body of Christ going to stand up against this fashionable vice and say NO to gossip, slander, backbiting, whispering, and tale bearing?

Let us pray: Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. (Psalm 141:3) Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer. (Psalm 19:14)</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>As for God, His way is perfect.  For the disciples of Christ it is always good to pray, Lead me in the way everlasting.  To harmonize our steps with His Word is a very wise thing to do.  You see, opposites in the Kingdom of God are costly in their differences.  The opposite of Gods perfect way is mans imperfect way.  
     	
Oh, how glorious to be able to declare like David did, I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way  I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.  What a joy to know that our Perfect Rock has promised to perfect that which concerns me.  What a strength there is as I walk in the Spirit and experience His perfect peace.  Why would I settle for anything less?  
     	
Oh yes, there is that constant battle going on between the flesh and the Spirit, and quite often I begin to buckle under the pressure of temptation or compromise.  However, at the very peak of the encounter Jesus quietly whispers to me, My strength is made perfect in weakness.  He indeed always causes me to triumph.  Im so guilty of cutting the work of God short in my life.    
     	
He desires that I go on to perfection and that I bring forth good fruit.  When I realize that both in and through Jesus Im secure and accepted for all eternity, that perfect love casts out those fears of rejection or failure.  Face it, 
perfection this side of glory is at best a dream.  Nevertheless, that desire to be like Jesus does serve as a powerful incentive to press on.
      	
May Gods love be perfected in us;20 may it cover a multitude of sins;21 may it be that bond of perfection22 that produces Christ-honoring, God-glorifying fruit.  </ns3:encoded>

		<title>The Fruit Of Love - Refreshment</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Thomas AKempis once said, Id rather be able to demonstrate love than know how to define it.  Jesus said, By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love one to another.  When agape love is truly working in our lives, its effect within the body of Christ will be that of refreshment.  
     	
Three Greek words translated into the English refresh in some form also carry the idea of to be eased; given rest; relieved.  The apostle Paul repeatedly acknowledged the outcome of being around Spirit-filled saints.  He desired the 
fellowship at Rome and its subsequent refreshment.  He was thankful for the support of Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus and the relief that they, by Gods grace, brought to him. The Corinthians were applauded for the help they gave to Titus.  And again, Paul cited the house of Onesiphorus and how he oftentimes eased his load.  Pauls short epistle to Philemon points out the fact that this brothers love brought joy and consolation to many, in addition to bringing the supply of spiritual refreshment.  
     	
The question echoes in my mind, Raymond, what effect spiritually do you have on others?  Ask yourself the same question.  Are you one of those saints that brings refreshment to others when you enter a room because of Jesus in you?  Do you ease the burdens of others, or do you add to them?  Do you bring spiritual refreshment into the camp by acknowledging every good thing in Christ, or is your conversation a continuous cycle of complaints and woes?  Ive personally been refreshed many times by your lives!
     	
As we continue to grow, may we each endeavor to maintain harmony in Christ, which is refreshing in our world of chaos and strife. Being faithful to Christs command to love, in season and out, will produce the refreshment that we all need and, more importantly, will refresh the heart of our Master.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Agape In Everything</title>

		<ns3:encoded>In our studies we find out that gifts and sacrifices without agape amounts to nothing.  The fruit of the Spirit is love that is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.  This love from above enables us to exercise faith.  This love unmasks hypocrisy.  However, we must also realize that agape rebukes too. 
     	
In these difficult times, how vital it is that we have on the breastplate of faith and love.  How important that we let brotherly love continue, the kind of brotherly love that serves, forbears, edifies, and labors in the Kingdom of God.  Abounding love! What a witness to a hating, selfish society!       	

There are times in your walk when it may seem that your labors for Jesus are in vain because they go unappreciated by people; but Jesus knows.  To walk in love as Christ did gives us that peace within that all things will be okay, even though today they are not okay. 
     	
The greatest demonstration of this agape love is seen in Calvarys cross.  Gods love for you is always mentioned in connection with the cross.  We love Him because He first loved us.  To reflect on this gift of eternal life through Jesus is indeed a mental focus on whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are noble, ...whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely.  Our Father loves us, Jesus declared, just as He loves Jesus!  How can that be?  Ill never comprehend the plan of redemption, but my heart leaps for joy when I think of those words, It is finished! 
     	
Beloved, let us love one another in a brotherly way.  Love is not the absence of trouble or friction.  It is not a goose-bumpy or warm, fuzzy feeling.  Its the presence of Jesus Christ in my heart, the hope of glory.  Its the presence of Christ in us, perfecting and molding each of us into His image, which is love.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>You Shall Be Witnesses Unto Me</title>

		<ns3:encoded>This passage of Scripture from Acts 1:8 is our Lords guarantee of power and the thrust for evangelism.  The purpose of the Holy Spirit, directly or indirectly, is to testify of Jesus.  When the Holy Spirit is active in our lives, the fruit of His work is a good witness for Jesus Christ.   
     	
God knew very well that man, left to himself, could only produce flesh.  The prophet Joel prophesied about the age when Gods Spirit would be poured out upon all flesh.  Jesus Himself declared that He had to go away so that the Comforter could come.  
     	
Now, we are all aware of the inability of our flesh to produce fruit or spiritual gifts.  However, we often become so concerned about what God is doing in us that we neglect to see why God is working through us.  His work is so that His Son Jesus would be glorified.  We have been predestined to be conformed to His image.  Just as Jesus is the express image of the Father, we are to be the express image of Jesus.  
     	
Whether we like it or not, we are witnesses for the Lord at all times.  And in order to be effective, fruitful witnesses, its imperative that we be controlled by the Spirit of God.  In fact, the Greek word for witness is martus, or the English equivalent, martyr.  After the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you become a martyr for Christ, dying to sin and self.  The result?  Power  dynamite!  
     	
May we yield to Gods Spirit more and more, and in so doing become dynamic witnesses for Jesus!</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Blessed Are The Meek</title>

		<ns3:encoded>The prophet Isaiah declared that The Spirit of the Lord GOD was upon Jesus Christ because the LORD had anointed Him to preach good tidings unto the meek (&lt;strong&gt;Isaiah 61:1&lt;/strong&gt;). Scripture declares that it is the meek who receive the engrafted word, which is able to save their souls (&lt;strong&gt;James 1:21&lt;/strong&gt;). So, a person is unable to be meek in the biblical sense until he or she is born again of Gods Spirit (&lt;strong&gt;John 3:3-8&lt;/strong&gt;).

When we look into the biblical meaning of the word meek, it is important to understand that it does not mean weak. The fact that Jesus personal profile is that He is meek (gentle) and lowly of heart (&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 11:29, 21:5&lt;/strong&gt;) should dispel the misconception that meek means weak. Meekness follows being poor in spirit (humble) and mourning for sin. This meekness is a fruit of the Spirit (&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 5:23&lt;/strong&gt;). In other words, it is not a product of this world or the natural order; it is a supernatural, divine work of God within the child of God.

Because we are not preprogrammed robots, our God given-responsibility as the elect, or chosen people of God, is to put on the virtue of meekness as Gods Word commands (&lt;strong&gt;Colossians 3:12&lt;/strong&gt;). Meekness is something that is to be sought after (&lt;strong&gt;Zephaniah 2:3; 1 Timothy 6:11&lt;/strong&gt;) and put into practice within the family of God (&lt;strong&gt;Ephesians 4:1-3&lt;/strong&gt;) and before all men (&lt;strong&gt;Titus 3:2&lt;/strong&gt;). In a day and age when the world flaunts a persons outward appearance, God reminds us that meekness is something of greater value (&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3:3-4&lt;/strong&gt;). Because we are all prone to wander and fall, meekness is a vital quality in the restoration of a fallen saint (&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6:1,2&lt;/strong&gt;). Because the spirit of this world is anti Christ, the wisdom that it puts forth is in stark contrast to the wisdom that comes from above, which is rooted in divine meekness (&lt;strong&gt;James 3:13&lt;/strong&gt;). Oh, how important meekness is within the body of Christ and in our efforts to reach the lost! Not only is meekness a key to successful evangelism (&lt;strong&gt;1 Peter 3:15&lt;/strong&gt;), but when it is necessary to address areas of sin or disorder within the body, we must be sure that we do so in meekness and gentleness (&lt;strong&gt;2 Corinthians 10:1&lt;/strong&gt;).

We read in &lt;strong&gt;Matthew 5:5 &lt;/strong&gt;that the meek shall inherit the earth. This promise comes from &lt;strong&gt;Psalm 37:11&lt;/strong&gt;: But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Do not despair about your lowly place in this world, beloved. For the child of God, the best is yet to come! Remember, being meek is not following a definition; it is being like Jesus.

		<ns3:encoded>With this post we begin a lengthy study of the Prison Epistles of the apostle Paul. What we see in these epistles (as in the rest of Scripture), is that the content of these letters are:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God centered&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christ exalting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spirit filled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These documents are given to us by God Himself with the purpose of producing. God centered, Christ exalting, Spirit filled churches, marriages, families, saints and children.

The ultimate practical purpose for these letters is to reveal what God has done for us in the Person of His Son Jesus Christ, and by believing in Him, be filled with The Spirit to live lives that bring glory and honor to God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Co 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What are the Prison Epistles? &lt;/b&gt;

Let me give them to you in the order that we will be studying them.

Colossians, Philippians, Philemon and lastly, the letter to the Ephesians. Each of these letters was written by Paul from Rome.

It has been said, tongue in cheek, that we need to be careful what we pray for. Paul had a deep desire to go to Rome. Not as a tourist to snap photos, but as a witness for Jesus Christ. Paul was a man who was constrained by the love of Christ who desired to see people come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ by the preaching of the gospel, as well as see the body of Christ grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord.&lt;!--more--&gt;

God in His providence answered Pauls prayer to go to Rome in a most remarkable way. After being apprehended by Roman authorities because he caused a riot preaching about Jesus Christ and taught that through him, there would be the resurrection from the dead, we read in &lt;b&gt;Acts 25.9-11 &lt;/b&gt;that Paul made an appeal to stand before Caesar Augustus. To stand before Caesar, God would either bring Caesar to wherever Paul was, or God would bring Paul to Rome. God chose to bring Paul to Rome, and you can read about all of the ministry that took place on this amazing boat ride and stop on the island of Melita enroute to Rome in &lt;b&gt;Acts 27 &lt;/b&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;28.&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/61493065"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Thus, the human reason for Paul being sent to Rome was the crime of preaching that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, Who was foretold by the OT prophets, Who dies for our sins according to the Scripture, was buried, but rose again from the dead on the third day.

The divine reason for Paul going to Rome was that it was the sovereign, providential will of God for the purpose of the furtherance of the gospel in Europe.

&lt;b&gt;Brief background about Roman Society&lt;/b&gt;

Rome was the world power at the time of the writing of these epistles. There are some very striking similarities between ancient Rome and USA.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They prided themselves on their military might.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They prided themselves in their athletic abilities to the point where the star athletes were nearly worshipped as gods incarnate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They prided themselves in theatre and drama, and many of the actors and actresses were looked up to by society as being special people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They took pride in their educational institutions and universities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were extremely liberal in their religious beliefs. Spiritually speaking, they were a polytheistic society that embraced the philosophy that all religions are basically the same and all roads of spirituality lead to God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were very liberal morally. Any and every type of sexual expression was accepted as long as it was between consenting adults.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Their global goal was to colonize the then known world with their form of government, religious beliefs etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Later on in the first century, a custom developed where any Roman citizen was required to burn a pinch of incense and proclaim that Caesar is Lord..the implications for a Christian is obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The message of Paul to the Christian man or woman was that in response to the grace, mercy and love of Christ, they were to walk in newness of life, not being conformed to the philosophies and mores of Roman culture, but to be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ by the power of the Indwelling Holy Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When were these epistles written?&lt;/b&gt;

The majority of manuscript scholars tell us that these epistles were written during Pauls first imprisonment in Rome, between the years 61-65 A.D.

In &lt;b&gt;Acts 28.16-29&lt;/b&gt;, we learn that this imprisonment was more like a house arrest, where Paul was able to conduct a limited amount of ministry.

It has been estimated that Paul was saved around 3 years after Jesus ascended up into heaven around the year of 37 A.D., which would mean that Paul wrote these letters around 25-30 years after his conversion to Christ.

For those of you who may be new to the faith, you can read about the conversion of the apostle Paul (formerly Saul the Pharisee) in &lt;b&gt;Acts 9, 22 &lt;/b&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;26.&lt;/b&gt;

In these 3 accounts of Paul being apprehended by the risen Lord Jesus, he was told by Jesus that he would be:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A chosen vessel. We too are chosen by God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He would receive revelation knowledge of Gods will and purposes. We too have been given that revelation in The Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He would see The Just One, Jesus Christ. We too are able by faith to see Him Who is invisible, and one day, we will see our glorious King face to face.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He would be His witness of Christ before kings, Israel and the Gentiles. We too are called to be witnesses of Jesus Christ wherever we live, wherever we work, wherever we go to school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is recorded in &lt;b&gt;Acts 9 &lt;/b&gt;that Paul was told that he would suffer many things for His Names sake. As we open up these epistles, we learn that Paul was very much aware of Gods divine purpose for those sufferings, and the blessings that the church would receive as a result of the revelations that he was given during this time.

&lt;b&gt;Pauls perspective while in prison (compare to Joseph from Genesis 39, 40)&lt;/b&gt;

It will be noted in &lt;b&gt;Acts 23.18, 25.27 &lt;/b&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;28.17, &lt;/b&gt;that Paul is identified as the prisoner, a prisoner and the prisoner from Jerusalem.

But did Paul see himself as being a prisoner on Rome?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 3:1 For this cause I Paul, &lt;i&gt;the prisoner of Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; for you Gentiles,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 4:1  I therefore, &lt;i&gt;the prisoner of the Lord&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, {of the Lord: or, in the Lord} &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phm 1:1 Paul, &lt;i&gt;a prisoner of Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow labourer,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phm 1:9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a &lt;i&gt;prisoner of Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Remember the 3 points that I gave to you about the content of these epistles? They are all God centered, Christ exalting and Spirit filled theology.

Beloved, your theology (what you believe about God) will affect your perspective in life. It will affect how to respond to situations in your life.

While it is true that Paul requests prayer for deliverance from prison if it is Gods will, he is completely convinced that as long as he is in that prison cell, he is there according to the good, perfect and acceptable will of God.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Introduction to the Prison Epistles, Pt. 2</title>

		<ns3:encoded>Paul is completely convinced that he is in prison according to the good, perfect and acceptable will of God. Instead of moaning and crying and complaining, he is:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abiding in Christ and looking for ways to bring glory to him as long as he is there.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Concerned for others and praying for others.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Seeking to minister to others in the prison and encourage his brothers and sisters in Christ outside of those prison walls who are under the attack of false teachings. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Paul writes, &lt;b&gt;all the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household&lt;/b&gt; (Php 4.22), it is widely accepted that Paul was used by God to lead many soldiers to Christ while in prison (cp. &lt;b&gt;Acts 16.23-34).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In fact, the epistle to the Philippians has been called over the years the epistle of joy. Time does not permit me to go into great depth about the vast difference between our joy which is something that is deep within our souls, and only found in a living relationship and fellowship the Lord Jesus Christ and happiness, which is all external, and depends upon the chances and changes in life, be it our health, our finances, our weather, our team loses the game etc.

Beloved, I must tell you in the Name of Jesus Christ that there is a happiness heresy that has entered the human bloodstream of the body of Christ and it not born of the Spirit of God.

Because of a false man-centered, me-centered gospel, where the itching ears message is that Gods supreme plan for your life is to be happy, many people (&lt;i&gt;not all of course&lt;/i&gt;) are walking out of the covenant of marriage, walking out of churches, moving to other states, allbecause they are no longer happy where they are.

Beloved, nowhere in Scripture does God say that Jesus came to make us happy. Christ came to make us holy. Jesus didnt die on the cross to do our bidding and pleasure, Jesus died on the cross that we might live for His pleasure and glory.

Blessed, oh how happy, are those people whose God is the Lord, the blessed man, the blessed woman is the man or woman who trusts in the Lord and can praise Him and serve Him, and worship Him wherever the providence of God places him, whatever their marital state or even if you live in the state of New York!&lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

I apologize for forgetting the website that I read this from, but it echoes what I am talking about here about the importance of having a God centered, Christ exalting, Spirit filled divine perspective in life:

WE WOULD EXPECT a prisoner to say something like this: "I am poor and miserable!" BUT PAUL SAID to the Ephesians, "I am rich and blessed with more blessings than I can even count" (Ephesians 1:3). This is the message of Ephesians.

WE WOULD EXPECT a prisoner to say something like this: "I am the most unhappy and discontented person in the whole world!" BUT PAUL SAID to the Philippians, "I can rejoice at all times and I can be content in whatsoever state I am in, even when I am in prison" (Philippians 4:4,11). This is the message of PHILIPPIANS.

WE WOULD EXPECT a prisoner to say something like this: "I am in desperate need. Life is terrible!" BUT PAUL SAIDto the Colossians, "Christ is everything I need! Christ is my Life!" (Colossians 2:10; 3:3). This is the message of Colossians.

WE WOULD EXPECT that if a Christian were thrown into jail he might say, "Lord, I need to get out of here so that I can start serving the Lord again!" BUT PAUL SERVED THE LORD even during his time in prison. He even preached the gospel to a runaway slave named Onesimus and this man was saved. This is the message of Philemon.

&lt;b&gt;Some of the doctrines and topics that we will be covering&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The deity of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Supremacy of Christ in His creation and in His church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mystery of the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Spiritual warfare.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The progressive sanctification of the saints.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gods design for marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christian work ethics.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pauls prayers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Walking in love and forgiveness within the body of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Last, but certainly not least, the absolute sufficiency of the atoning sacrifice and bodily resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ from the dead as full payment for our sins. Salvation is a gift from God that is unconditional, undeserved and it granted to sinners by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We will be looking at the enemies of the gospel that are alive and well on planet earth today.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Legalism- Jesus plus ritual or good works=salvation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mysticism- Jesus plus an esoteric or spiritual experience= salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gnosticism-Jesus plus special revelation knowledge=salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Asceticism-Jesus plus the denial of things=salvation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Beloved, any ism be it a form of godliness, a spiritual experience, a system of theology inevitably becomes the focus of a persons faith rather than Jesus alone. Jesus plus anything else is an ism.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No religious ordinance can add to the all sufficient atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No spiritual experience can eclipse the precious intimacy that a child of God can have with The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No system of theology on ANY end of the spectrum can ever describe the fullness of the character and majesty of God and the depths of His love for us that is expressed in His Beloved Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul, who will write about all of these doctrines, summed up his practical theology this way.&lt;b&gt;follow me as I follow Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Here is Christianity according to Jesus:
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Come unto Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn of Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abide in Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seek Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Obey Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Serve Me. Occupy 'til I come.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look unto Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remember Me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Beloved, the one cure for sin and all of the ails and pains and sorrows that come along with it is the glorious, life changing, transforming gospel of The Lord Jesus Christ.

He came to seek and to save that which was lost. He came for the brokenhearted and weary. He died on the cross for sinners, for those who are ungodly, for those who are His enemies.

Jesus Christ came to be our Shepherd to guide us throughout our lives, our High Priest for us to confide in times of failure and falling, Our Refuge and Strong Tower in times of trouble, Our Healer in times of pain, Our Comforter in times of sorrow and loss.

The gospel is not try harder, do better, be stronger; it is trust Christ! You can trust Him today, for today is the day of salvationif The Spirit of God is stirring your heart to embrace the Lordship of Jesus today, we would love to pray for you. Call us at (585) 385-0450.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Colossians 1: 1-8</title>

		<ns3:encoded>As I mentioned in my &lt;a title="Introduction to the Prison Epistles" href="/intro-prison-epistles/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, this epistle to the Colossians is one of four Prison Epistles along with Ephesians, Philippians and Philemon. Paul wrote all of these epistles during his first imprisonment while he was in Rome awaiting trial before Caesar. As we have already seen, some of the most encouraging letters of Paul were written when he was in prison.

Internal evidence suggests that though Paul had not visited Colosse (2.1), Timothy and Epaphras (1.7) had evangelized the city and founded the church during Pauls 3 year stay in Ephesus while on his third missionary journey. Colosse is about 100 miles east of Eph. The church here was primarily composed of Gentiles.

The epistle was written to combat certain heretical teachings that had crept into the church and have never gone away! We will address these heresies as we go through this powerful epistle. These false teachings were Gnosticism; Legalism, Mysticism and secular philosophy.&lt;!--more--&gt;

False teachers also denied the Deity of Jesus Christ as Creator and His all-sufficient atonement for sin that grants salvation to sinners by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, not of works or ritual lest any man should boast.

According to &lt;b&gt;Col 4.16,&lt;/b&gt;this epistle was to be read to then neighboring church of Laodicea, and a letter that was written to the Laodiceas (not included in the canon of Scripture) was to be read to the saints at Colosse. So, lets jump into Colossians together:&lt;a title="Colossians Video" href="https://vimeo.com/62153596"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,&lt;/b&gt;

Paul was not one of the original 12 Apostles (&lt;b&gt;Acts 1:21-26&lt;/b&gt;) who were with Christ from the beginning of His earthly ministry (&lt;b&gt;Acts 1:22; Luke 1:2; John 15:27&lt;/b&gt;). Nevertheless he did see the risen Christ (&lt;b&gt;1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8-9&lt;/b&gt;), and he did possess special miraculous powers that were given to him by God to authenticate his apostolic authority (&lt;b&gt;2 Cor. 12:12; cf. Heb. 2:3-4&lt;/b&gt;).

The word apostle means, "&lt;i&gt;One sent out&lt;/i&gt;". Because the content of this epistle is addressing doctrinal heresies, Paul speaks from apostolic authority. Paul's right to speak with this authority is based upon the fact that he is a chosen vessel of the Lord Jesus who is has been called and sent out by God, not only as an ambassador of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. But as a preserver of Gods truth and protector of Gods people.

There are no capital A apostles on earth today. However, each and every Christian should live each and every day with the realization that we are sovereignly and providentially and deliberately being &lt;i&gt;sent out&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;daily&lt;/i&gt; to be a witness for Jesus Christ in the world as salt and light. Beloved, wherever the sovereignty of God has placed you vocationally, that is your mission field. In fact I would go as far as saying that wherever the Lord has you living, going to school, exercising, shopping etc, that too is your mission field.

Please note that he is an apostle not because he went to school or because it seemed like a good and noble career to be devoted to. Paul was an apostle &lt;b&gt;by the will of God&lt;/b&gt;. It was God Who separated Paul from his mothers womb. It was God who saved Paul. It was God Who called Paul into the ministry, put the ministry into him and enabled Paul to serve Him in that capacity. His call to be an apostle was not something which he had earned or achieved; it is calling which has been given him by God. &lt;b&gt;"You did not choose me,&lt;/b&gt;" said Jesus, &lt;b&gt;"but I chose you" (Jn.15:16).&lt;/b&gt;

Here, right at the outset of the letter, we find a snapshot of the amazing doctrine of the grace of God. A Christian man or woman is not what he or she has made himself or herself to be. The Christian man or woman is what they are by the grace of God.

Timothy was in prison with Paul. He is also listed as being with him in Philippians and Philemon, but not in Ephesus.

Timothy had a Gentile father (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:1&lt;/b&gt;) but his mother and grandmother were godly Jewesses (&lt;b&gt;2 Tim. 1:5&lt;/b&gt;) from whom he had learned the Old Testament Scriptures from childhood (&lt;b&gt;2 Tim. 3:15&lt;/b&gt;). Paul picked up Timothy on his second missionary journey at Lystra where the brothers  spoke well of him (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:2&lt;/b&gt;). Paul spent much time discipling Timothy and wrote two of his last letters to him.

Timothy was a young man that ministered with Paul in the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was likeminded with Paul in ministry. Paul did not teach Timothy how to be a disciple in a classroom, he taught him by example and by coming alongside of him.

What a joy it is to see so many younger brothers and sisters growing in the Lord and serving here in the church. How exciting it is to see the Timothys that the Lord is raising up to serve Him around here in so many areas.

&lt;i&gt;It has been said that the church is one generation away from possible extinction. How we needs to invest in our young people.&lt;/i&gt; Moms, dads...are you discipling your children in the Lord Jesus? Are you spending time reading the Scriptures and praying with them? Do your children see you and your wife reading the Scriptures and praying together? Or are you depending upon the Nursery servants or Sunday School or Youth Group leaders to do that? We can only supplement what you are doing at home.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Greek word here for &lt;b&gt;saints&lt;/b&gt; means, "&lt;i&gt;Holy, different, set aside for the Masters use&lt;/i&gt;." For example, the Temple was &lt;i&gt;holy&lt;/i&gt;, in that it was set apart, different from other buildings. The Sabbath was &lt;i&gt;holy&lt;/i&gt; for the Jewish people in that it was set apart, different from the other days of the week.

Holiness or sanctification for the child of God is a progressive work of The Spirit of God within our lives that conforms us into the image of Jesus Christ in order that we might be &lt;b&gt;vessels unto honor&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;fit for the Masters use, &lt;/b&gt;in a fallen, post Christian culture that is separated from God by sin and blinded to the gospel by the god of this world. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The term saint has been so misunderstood both inside and outside of the church. Please understand that contrary to heretical teaching by the R.C. church,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the term saints, is used in Scripture to refer to &lt;i&gt;all believers&lt;/i&gt;, not a special group of believers who possess distinguished virtues and performed verifiable miracles. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Sainthood is not an &lt;i&gt;accomplishment&lt;/i&gt; for work done on earth; sainthood is a &lt;i&gt;position&lt;/i&gt; held by every single person that embraces Jesus Christ as Lord, and the position of sainthood is imputed to the believer by faith and is based upon Christs finished work on the cross, death, burial, bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Please note that these saints are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;in Christ&lt;/b&gt;. Nobody is &lt;i&gt;born&lt;/i&gt; by natural birth in Christ; we are all born in Adam. And just as we have had a natural, physical human birth &lt;i&gt;in Adam&lt;/i&gt;, we need a spiritual, supernatural birth &lt;i&gt;in Christ.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The word&lt;b&gt; faithfu&lt;/b&gt;l speaks of their absolute trust in Jesus Christ, and obedience to Him as Lord.

Note that these saints, like you and I, have a dual residency. Every single born again follower of Jesus Christ has an earthly residence, but more importantly, you have eternal home.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14:1 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Saints are made on earth but move to heaven! &lt;/i&gt;We live and work here on earth, but at the same time, &lt;b&gt;we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&lt;/b&gt; As believers, we may move from one city to another city or from one job to another job; but wherever we are &lt;i&gt;geographically&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;spiritually and positionally, &lt;/i&gt;we are in Christ Jesus, for it is &lt;b&gt;in Him that we live and move and have our being.&lt;/b&gt;

That is one of the reasons why we are called to do any job with all of our heart &lt;i&gt;as unto the Lord&lt;/i&gt;. The vocation that you are engaged in as a believer may outwardly appear to be menial, unpleasant and physically challenging. I may be doing a job that is far less than what my college degree tells me I am qualified to do. The earthly pay and rewards may be small and insignificant. Nevertheless as Christians, we are all called to be about our Fathers business, doing all things diligently, uncomplainingly and cheerfully, for we are in Christ and are called to do all things as unto the Lord. Paul will tell us:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Grace&lt;/b&gt;- God's undeserved, unmerited favor that has been shed out abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Lord. The best acronym that I have ever read for the word grace is this.you have heard me say it many times and you can probably quote it verbatim. Gods Riches At Christs Expense.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peace&lt;/b&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Rom 5.1&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This peace has been made through the blood of Jesus on the cross. &lt;b&gt;Col 1.20.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Once again note that the grace of God &lt;i&gt;precedes&lt;/i&gt; the peace of God and that is because you will never experience the peace of God apart from experiencing the grace of God through Jesus Christ. This peace beloved is not to be understood as being the absence of trouble or trial or sorrow.this peace is a Person and His Name is Jesus Christ. The peace that God gives is not of this world and is a peace that passes understanding.

As Colossians begins, Paul writes, &lt;b&gt;grace be unto you&lt;/b&gt;, so it will end, &lt;b&gt;grace be with you&lt;/b&gt; And that is because from the womb to the grave, &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;of life for the child of God is a sum total of the sovereign, providential unspeakable grace of God. Every breath that you and I take today is because of the grace of God. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Though Paul was a prisoner of Rome, he touched the world with his prayers. The most important ministry in the body of Christ is prayer. Every other visible ministry stands or falls on prayer. Prayer is a direct access to the throne of God Our Father. The word we suggests that Paul and Timothy often prayed for these saints.

Note how Paul expressed thanks and appreciation for these brothers and sisters in Christ whom he had never met personally. How important it is for us to verbalize our appreciation for our spouses, our parents, our children and for one another in the body of Christ. We tend to take one another for granted...This simple truth is so powerful.

Thanksgiving unto God for His work in our lives in powerful beloved. Just ask the 1 leper in &lt;b&gt;Luke 17 &lt;/b&gt;who was miraculously touched by the Lord Jesus. While all 10 lepers were cleansed by Jesus, only the 1 leper who returned to gave thanks and glory to God was made whole.

Many of Gods people lack wholeness in their lives because they are murmurers, complainers, fault finders and critical of others instead of appreciative for who that person is in Christ and thankful for the grace of God that He has bestowed upon them.

May the Spirit of God grant unto each and every one of us a baptism of thanksgiving!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, 5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Note that we find here faith, hope, and love, just like in &lt;b&gt;Rom 5:2-5; 1 Cor 13:13; Gal 5:5, 6; 1 Thess 1:3; 5:8. &lt;/b&gt;These are the 3 characteristics of a mature saint and a healthy church.

&lt;b&gt;Faith looks upward&lt;/b&gt;- The first mark of a spiritually maturing believer and congregation is faith. The author of Hebrews tells us that &lt;b&gt;without faith, it is impossible to please God. &lt;/b&gt;

When the Bible talks about the faith of the believer, it must be understood that it is the object of our faith that is being talked about, not faith in our own faith.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Note here that Paul commends their &lt;b&gt;faith in Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;Beloved, our faith this morning and throughout the day is to be in the Lord and His Word, not our faith. &lt;b&gt;Without faith it is impossible to please God&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Heb 11.6&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Rom 10.17&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;The sower soweth the seed..the seed is the word of God (Luke 8.5,11). The just shall live by faith.&lt;/b&gt;

The church service is not meant to be an entertainment show, nor a rambling on of human speculations and opinions. Nor is it to be an hour of intellectual presentation of words that nobody but Daniel Webster himself can understand. To &lt;b&gt;continue in the apostles doctrine &lt;/b&gt;means that our time together today and this evening, Lord willing should be a time of sowing of the &lt;b&gt;living, powerful, incorruptible word of God. &lt;/b&gt;And my friends, the DNA of the Word of God is eternal life and faith in God.

Therefore, the church that gathers together without believing God is going to do great things will not experience renewal, revival, or blessing.

If you have come here today out of habit or out of routine, instead of believing that Jesus is going to speak our hearts do great things in our midst, then your faith the church service to you will eventually become stale, your worship will eventually become dry, and you will fail to experience the refreshment and power of the Holy Spirit. Receive by faith what God is doing RIGHT NOW! &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Love looks outward&lt;/b&gt;- the love of God is unselfish and is meant to be shed abroad from our hearts. Love is Christ exalting and others centered. This is the greatest gift that any Christian or church family can have is love (&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 13&lt;/b&gt;). This is the motive that Jesus is looking for in all that we do. (&lt;b&gt;Rev 2.4; 2 Cor 5.14; Gal 5.22&lt;/b&gt;)... The Christian must have faith; he must know what he believes. But he must also have love for men; he must turn that belief into action. It is not enough simply to have faith, for there can be an orthodoxy which knows no love.... Faith in Christ and love to men are the twin pillars of the Christian life.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Hope looks forward to being with the Lord in heaven&lt;/b&gt;- Peter writes that this hope is reserved for all those that call upon The Name of the Lord. The hope of seeing Christ and going to heaven is not only a motivation for faith and love, but it is also a motivation for holy living.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure (1 John 3:3). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Heavenly hope is the inspiration for saintly service. Here is a quote from John Piper:

&lt;i&gt;Let me ask you a question. Is it true that when Christians set their hearts earnestly and intensely on the future prospect of sharing the glory of God, and seeing the risen Lord, and spending eternity with Him, that they are of no earthly use? Do they become self-centered and fall prey to escapism?&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Today's message is intended to show that the Bible portrays just the opposite. It teaches and shows that a strong confidence in the promises of God and a passionate preference for the joy of heaven over the joy of the world frees a person from worldly self-centeredness, from paralyzing regret and self-pity, from fear and greed and bitterness and despair and laziness and impatience and envy. And in the place of all these sins, hope bears the fruit of love.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It is not heavenly-mindedness that hinders love. It is worldly-mindedness that hinders love, even when it is disguised by a religious routine on the weekend. Only one thing satisfies the heart whose treasure is in heaven: doing the works of heaven. And heaven is a world of love! It is not the cords of heaven that bind the hands of love. It is the love of money and leisure and comfort and praisethese are the cords that bind the hands of love. And the power to sever these cords is Christian hope.&lt;/i&gt; John Piper&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As Paul just wrote, it is this gospel of the grace of God that brings forth fruit.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;When a person is truly converted, they will bring forth fruit. When Jesus is truly living in a persons heart, there will be fruit. &lt;b&gt;Gal 5.22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance:&lt;/b&gt;

This fruit is the result of fellowship with Jesus moment by moment. (&lt;b&gt;John15&lt;/b&gt;). Religion, like fig leaves can only irritate you....religion can only be a source of discomfort for you.... religion is a form of godliness but no power.religion is a corpse covered with makeup. The gospel of Jesus Christ is resurrection life and power for the glory of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Epaphras was a minister (Greek &lt;i&gt;diakonos&lt;/i&gt;) of Christ...the Greek word means a table waiter or servant (&lt;b&gt;Jn 2:5, 9&lt;/b&gt;). As followers of Jesus Christ, each one of us are called to be servants of the Lord Jesus Christ. To be a servant of King Jesus is what true greatness is all about. (&lt;b&gt;Mk 10:43&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

In addition to being called a dear fellow servant, Epaphras was also a man of prayer and great zeal (&lt;b&gt;4.12,13&lt;/b&gt;). I am so blessed to be surrounded by so many praying, godly, holy, Spirit filled saints who love Jesus so much and are faithful to His call upon their lives. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Epaphras did not simply lead the Colossians to Christ and then abandon them. He taught them the Word and sought to establish their faith. The word translated learned in Colossians 1:7 is related to the word disciple in the Greek language. It is the same word Jesus used: &lt;b&gt;Learn of Me&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Matt. 11:29&lt;/b&gt;) or, in effect, Become My disciple. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The Great Commission does not stop with the salvation of the lost, for in that commission Jesus commanded us to teach converts the Word as well (&lt;b&gt;Matt. 28:1920&lt;/b&gt;). Thus our 4 fold mission here at KF is to know Christ, grow in Christ, proclaim Christ and glorify Christ.

Winning souls.growing in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus, and brining Him glory is what of the local church is all about.

I like Epaphras. He went about speaking around speaking about the love in the Spirit. Beloved, may I encourage you to be like Epaphras. May I encourage you to talk about how what a blessing this brother or that sister is behind his or her back, for not only does this please the Lord, but it also has an impact on me as well. How? To a very real degree, you are the person I say you are when youre not around. You see, if when you leave church and, on your way home, talk about what an idiot the pastor is, he will become that person to you the next time you meet. Talk negatively about him, and, even if those things are not totally true, thats what he will become in your sight. On the other hand, if you speak well of a person behind his back, that is the way you will tend to view him.

Epaphras spoke about the love of God that was flowing through this body. Gossip good things about others and you will find yourself noticing good things in others.

In closing my friends, What is the gospel?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify &lt;i&gt;the gospel of the grace of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ro 4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 6 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 7 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of grace and peace is the power of God unto salvation. The grace of God through Jesus Christ means that He died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that He was buried and rose again according to the Scriptures. We are heaven bound because of what Jesus did for us. We are complete in Him. Every time we have communion we are reminded of that simple, but powerful truth.

We are not saved by faith in faith. There is a cult of believism today that promotes faith but has little to do with Jesus Christ. Saving faith involves the mind, the emotions, and the will. With the mind we understand the truth of the Gospel, and with the heart we feel conviction and the need to be saved. But it is only when we by the power or The Holy Spirit exercise the will and commit ourselves to Christ that the process is complete. Faith is not mental assent to a body of doctrines, no matter how true those doctrines may be. Faith is not emotional concern. Faith is a God given belief that Jesus died for my sins according to the Scriptures. That He was buried and rose again according to the Scriptures. And as a response to the work truth of Gods Word and the prompting of The Spirit, I confess that Jesus is The Son of God and based upon what He has done for us, I commit the keeping of my soul to Him, and the remainder of my life to serving Him as Master and Lord.

		<ns3:encoded>This section of Scripture gives us a glimpse into the prayer life of Paul and Timothy. These Spirit filled passages provide us some wonderful things that we can be praying for one another. Whenever we pray for one another, we are making a divine deposit into their lives.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Heard what? Of their faith in Christ Jesus and love for all the saints because of their hope that is laid up for them in heaven.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; 12  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: 14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/62610281"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We left off in the last post with the Apostle saying, &lt;i&gt;when I heard the report from Epaphras, about what was happening in your midst, about how the Holy Spirit was working in your lives, about the graces that He had implanted, your faith, your love, your hope. We immediately started praying. We immediately engaged in a continuous round of prayer for you&lt;/i&gt;.

So often our prayer is in response to disaster, or affliction, or difficulty, and, of course, that's entirely appropriate. There's no better place to go than to God when things are going wrong.But, Paul's logic also drove him to prayer when he saw the Spirit of God doing a good work. Paul and Timothys example for us reminds us that we must attend to prayer, not only in the hard times, but especially in the times where spiritual work is going on, that the work of the spirit might continue and increase.

I draw your attention to the fact that Paul began this prayer back in verse 3 by the giving of thanks to God.

To ask that &lt;b&gt;you may be filled with the knowledge of His will&lt;/b&gt;:

What a wonderful thing to pray for other saints. That the might be filled with the knowledge of His will. Gods word is Gods will. Thus one of the ways that we know the will of God is by spending time reading renewing his or her mind with Gods truth the Word every believe and renewing our minds with the Word of God. This is the revealed will of God.

But then there is that concealed will of God that is not written in Scripture. Gods will concerning my vocation, or concerning His direction for how to handle a particular financial issue or issues with my children, or marital issues. To know what Gods will is in matters like this is discovered as we spend time praying and listening for His still small voice.

Paul prays for a knowledge of God which is consistent with the gospel that's already been preached. He wants a knowledge of God which is biblical. He wants a knowledge of God which is not merely abstract or speculative, but which has practical content to it. He prays for a knowledge of God which bears fruit. The true knowledge of which Paul and Timothy are praying for is biblical truth which is in accord with the Scriptures and it flows from the revelation of God in the Scripture.

The kind of knowledge that we are talking about beloved is character transforming knowledge. The knowledge of God is a transforming knowledge that is far more than a change of information in the head (which it is), as much as it is a &lt;i&gt;transformation of the heart&lt;/i&gt;. When a persons heart changes, the way they think changes and the way the way they pray and make decisions changes. The heart will always make a convert of the mind.

Please know this: Gods will never contradict Gods Word. You do not need to pray if it is Gods will that you date or marry someone that is not a born again believer. You do not have to pray about whether or not you should work under the table. You should not need to pray about whether or not I should sell drugs on the side to provide for my family or be living together with my boyfriend or girlfriend. Gods will on these issues is not even close to being a gray matter.

Let me tell you straightforwardly beloved that something's wrong in us if we have no desire for the knowledge of God or knowledge about Him, because the Apostle Paul says, &lt;i&gt;I'm praying that you Christians will have that&lt;/i&gt;.

Pastor Ligon Duncan said to his congregation, &lt;i&gt;in a place where teaching is stressed, we must be on guard that we never let our knowledge about God hang in the air, but that it is rooted in practical Christ living&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Filled&lt;/b&gt;-Note the word filled in v9. What does it mean to be filled w/something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Examples of the filling Paul is praying for are found in &lt;b&gt;Ephesians 5:18&lt;/b&gt;, where Paul commands Christians to be filled with the Spirit; &lt;b&gt;John 12:3&lt;/b&gt;, where the room is filled with the perfume when Mary anoints Jesus with the perfume; and &lt;b&gt;Acts 2:2&lt;/b&gt;, when the house is filled with the noise of the Spirit's coming.

In all cases, when the objects above are said to be filled they are totally dominated by the thing doing the filling. When we are filled with something, we are totally dominated by it.

That is Pauls prayer, that we be totally dominated by the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.

My prayer for each and every one of you beloved is that God would grant unto you a knowledge which is in accordance with the Word of God, which is a practical knowledge, which impacts your daily living, and which bears fruit. That's the kind of knowledge that I want you to grow in.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;That you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When the Apostle Paul speaks of walking in a &lt;b&gt;manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing unto Him&lt;/b&gt;, he is speaking of the standard of our behavior. He is speaking of the normal Christian life.

Those who are born again possess the true knowledge of God and are going to desire to please God in all respects. Our motivation for choosing to live the way that we do is rooted in the love for God and stems from a sincere and appropriate desire to please God. We are not motivated by guilt or fear, but by the love &lt;i&gt;of &lt;/i&gt;God and a love &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; God and His glory.

To walk in a way that is worthy and pleasing to The Lord essentially means that we are to emulate our Savior.The apostle John said, &lt;b&gt;He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked (1 John 2.6).&lt;/b&gt;

To walk as Jesus walked means that we should seek to walk as Jesus did in the world. Jesus always sought to do the things that were pleasing to His Father (&lt;b&gt;John 8.29&lt;/b&gt;). Jesus quietly honored God His Father in all His works and ways.A person who is walking worthy of The Lord, will be walking in the footsteps of The Lord Jesus. Remember that it was Paul, who said to the Corinthians, &lt;b&gt;follow me as I follow Christ&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(1 Cor 11.1).&lt;/b&gt;

He prayed that they would &lt;b&gt;be fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God&lt;/b&gt;. This is an echo of Jesus thought in &lt;b&gt;John 15:7-8: If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire and it shall be done for you. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples&lt;/b&gt;

Good words are empty apart from good works. Gods will for each and every one of you who are in Christ is that you would be &lt;b&gt;fruitful in every good work and increase in the knowledge of God. &lt;/b&gt;And the more we increase in the knowledge of God, the more that we will be fruitful we are in good works.

The emphasis of the Christian life is always on the vertical, not the horizontal.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2Pe 3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 9:23  Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: 24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It is as if Paul is saying I want you to have a knowledge of The Lord Jesus that leads you to desire to please God, not slavishly, but enthusiastically.

What is another thing that pleases God? Faith, for &lt;b&gt;without faith it is impossible to please God.&lt;/b&gt; Faith believes that Gods Word is true and that Gods will is best. Thus, when I walk by faith in His Word, trusting in the power of His grace to enable me to do so, I am walking in a way that pleases Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strengthened with all might according to His glorious power&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In order to walk worthy of The Lord, we need to be strengthened by His glorious power. It's so important to note again that Paul is pointing to a power that is outside of the Colossians. It's not a power within the Colossians that he's praying to be increased, it's a power which comes from God and which God implants in us and strengthens us with.

The God Who gives us strength is a God of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this strength; for we are &lt;b&gt;strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inward man, Eph. 3:16.&lt;/b&gt;

The kind of power that Paul is praying for is a prayer that grants divine&lt;b&gt; patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.&lt;/b&gt; Praise God beloved that we are in a covenant relationship with The Living God Who promises us that His strength is there to help us meet all of lifes challenges. That He provides the strength to endure and overcome problems with &lt;b&gt;patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.&lt;/b&gt;

Being patient relates to dealing with circumstances in our lives and timing, while longsuffering relates to dealing with people in our lives. Paul prays that God would fill these saints with His glorious power in order that they would be able to deal with difficult circumstances and difficult people &lt;b&gt;with joyfulness.&lt;/b&gt; If today you are dealing with difficult circumstances or difficult people or both, then pray this prayer!!

It is important for us to understand this morning that Paul is not saying that God expects us to go through difficult circumstances or problems without any feeling or emotion. He is not saying that when we are dealing with difficult circumstance or people, we should do cartwheels around the house singing zip a dee do dah!!!! He is reminding us that we no longer need to go through life in our own power or strength.

Because Jesus has finished the work of atoning for our sins on the cross, The Comforter has been poured out to live inside of us, to come along side of us.

Beloved, God's strength is perfected in our weakness.The old Puritan John Owen said many, many years ago, &lt;i&gt;We have no power from God unless we live in the persuasion that we have none of our own&lt;/i&gt;. Beloved, this power to live, this power to endure, this power to be joyous, this power to be patient comes from outside of us. It's not a power which is naturally within us, or a power which is merely untapped, or unrealized, or needing to being awakened or unlocked. It's a power which comes from God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giving thanks to the Father who has made us meet (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;qualified&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Paul says that The Father has &lt;b&gt;made us meet&lt;/b&gt;, or qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, he is saying that through the finished work of Jesus Christ, all the conditions have been met which entitle us to a full standing as the children of God.

In the divine administration, the Father is mentioned in connection with His plan of redemption because He is the Person of the Trinity Who initiated the plan to redeem fallen man before the foundation of the world. It is spoken of as the work of the Father, because the Spirit of grace is the Spirit of the Father, and the Father works in us by his Spirit.

Because our salvation is the work of God, Paul once again gives thanks unto God for His glorious grace and power that has enabled us &lt;b&gt;to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints&lt;/b&gt;:

It is the Father who qualifies us, not our own works. We gain this as an inheritance, instead of earning it as a wage.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Beloved, we overcome the devil &lt;b&gt;by the blood of The Lamb and the word of our testimony.&lt;/b&gt; Christians have been delivered from Satans domain. Notice, what tense is the verb in v13? Past tense, it is an already accomplished fact, if you have confessed Jesus as your Lord.

Jesus has &lt;b&gt;delivered us from the power of darkness. &lt;/b&gt;Another place where this same phrase for &lt;b&gt;power of darkness&lt;/b&gt; is used is in &lt;b&gt;Luke 22:53&lt;/b&gt;, where Jesus spoke of the darkness surrounding His arrest and passion in the same terms.

The entire fallen world system, with all its pretended wisdom and righteousness, is regarded as nothing but darkness in the sight of God, because, apart from the kingdom of Christ, there is no light.

We need to keep in mind that when the Bible says that someone is lost we mean lost! When the Bible says that someone is dead in their sins, it means dead! It is no small thing to be without Christ. And every person in Gods creation is either under Christ or under Satan

&lt;i&gt;There is no neutral ground in the universe: every square inch, every split second, is claimed by God and counterclaimed by Satan&lt;/i&gt;. (C.S. Lewis)

The very word &lt;b&gt;delivered &lt;/b&gt;has the idea of a rescue by a sovereign power. We could not and did not deliver ourselves from the power of darkness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Father has rescued us from the state of heathenish darkness and wickedness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He hath saved us from the dominion of sin, which is darkness (&lt;b&gt;1 Jn. 1:6&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has saved us from the dominion of Satan, who is the prince of darkness (&lt;b&gt;Eph. 6:12&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He has delivered us from the damnation of hell, which is utter darkness, &lt;b&gt;Mt. 25:30&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul will tell the saints in Ephesus that &lt;b&gt;you were once darkness, but now are you light in the Lord, Eph. 5:8&lt;/b&gt;. Peter tells us that it is God &lt;b&gt;Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light, 1 Pt. 2:9.&lt;/b&gt;

The regeneration and conversion of a sinner is the miraculous translation of a soul out of the kingdom of the devil and into the kingdom of Christ. The debt of sin is paid; the power of sin is shaken off, and the power of Christ submitted to. By the grace of God, we have been marvelously and graciously translated into the kingdom of His dear Son.

At the time that Paul wrote this letter, when one empire conquered another empire, the custom was to take the population of the defeated empire and transfer it lock, stock and barrel to the conquerors land. It is in this sense that Paul says we have been translated into Gods kingdom. Everything we have, everything we are now belongs to Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;In whom we have redemption through His blood&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;even the forgiveness of sin.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There are many people who teach that Jesus Christ came to show us the Father's love. That is true, but that is not all of the truth. Jesus Christ came to do more than to reveal to us what God is like. Jesus Christ came to redeem us from sin.

This redemption was procured through the blood of Christ, for it by the sacrifice of his death that all the sins of the world have been expiated. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that this is the sole price of reconciliation with God, and that apart from Christ, there is no reconciliation with God.

The word redemption has the idea of release by a legal ransom. In Pauls' day, if you wanted to set a slave free, you paid a purchase price for that slave and you redeemed, you literally bought that slave, and set him to freedom. This is precisely what the Apostle says Christ has done for us at the cross. The price for our release was paid by the blood of Jesus. The shed blood of Jesus Christ on the cross is the receipt of our lawful purchase as redeemed people.

Forgiveness is the ancient Greek word aphesis, most literally translated &lt;b&gt;a sending away&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;i&gt;It thus speaks of the removal of our sins from us, so that they are no longer barriers that separate us from God&lt;/i&gt;. (Vaughan)

Jesus has paid a costly price for us and set us free. The redemption that we have in Jesus Christ is both a pardon of sin and deliverance from sin. Every single one of us struggles with two aspects in sin. We are guilty of sin and therefore we are due its penalty. We are enslaved to sin and therefore we are under its power. Christ, in His redemption, redeems us from both. Forgiveness of sins entails both pardon for sins guilt and deliverance from sins power.

Being forgiven does not mean you are sinless. It does not mean you are perfect, but you are no longer under the dominion of sin. Your life is no longer as a whole characterized by a bent toward wickedness. When you sin, you are frustrated by it. You are not only remorseful of it, you are repentant of it.

It is vital for us to hold as a settled point, that we are not acceptable to God apart from Jesus Christ. Have you trusted Christ this morning for the salvation of your soul?

As far as other people goes, let me ask you this: Having read this prayer, is this how you're praying for one another? Are you praying that your brothers and sisters in Christ here at Koinonia Fellowship would be filled with the knowledge of Gods will for their lives? Are you praying that God would grant them the power to live in His will with patience and longsuffering and joy?

I believe that this prayer is Gods heart for each and very one of you this morning. This is what God desires for us.

On a personal level, do you desire the kind of knowledge that Paul is speaking about today? If you don't, my friend, something's wrong; something needs to be checked, something needs to be changed. Perhaps you need to avail yourself the first time to Christ.

In Christ we have redemption Jesus said on the cross, it is finished. There is nothing for you to do that can add to the perfect atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. If you or I could save ourselves, then there was no reason for Jesus to die on the cross.

May the grace of God open your heart and open your understanding to the truth of the gospel and the reality of Who Jesus Christ is. As many as received Him, to them give He the power to become the sons of God. Will you confess Jesus as Son of God, and receive Him as Lord today? We would love to pray with you.

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: 17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Before we get into a biblical understanding of Who Jesus Christ is from these Scriptures? Lets back up a bit to where we left off a &lt;a title="Colossians 1: 9-14" href="/colossians-1-9-14/"&gt;couple of blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title="Colossians 1: 9-14" href="/colossians-1-9-14/"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; ago.

Paul has just prayed for the Colossians that they would &lt;b&gt;be filled with the knowledge of [Gods] will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God (vv. 9-10).&lt;/b&gt; Then, in verses 14-20, he gives us a Spirit filled revelation of amazing truths about Jesus Christ that are probably the most concentrated description of the glories of Jesus in the New Testament. &lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a title="Colossians Video" href="https://vimeo.com/64066220"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Lets look at them briefly, but with awe and wonder:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 14: In Him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 15a: He is the image of the invisible God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 15b: He is the firstborn of all creationthat is, the specially honored, first and only Son over all creation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 16a: By him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. (We will come back to verse 16.) Verse 16b: All things were created through him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 16c: All things were created for him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 17a: He is before all things.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 17b: In him all things hold together.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 18a: He is the head of the body, the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 18b: He is the beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 18c: He is the firstborn from the dead.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 18d: In everything he is preeminent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 19: In him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 20a: He reconciles all things to himself, whether on earth or in heaven.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 20b: He makes peace by the blood of his cross.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This list is worth reading regularly and memorizing. Beloved, whenever your hearts grow cold or weary in the battle of life, read this list of the glories of The Lord Jesus Christ and ask The Holy Spirit of God to give you the heavenly affections that correspond to the description of His greatness.

God has given unto us a book to read, a mind to learn and The Spirit to reveal to us the majesty of His glory and the mystery of Who He is. The more we will be in awe of His majesty and greatness. The more that you learn about Jesus Christ, the more you will experience His love and peace. Jesus said, &lt;b&gt;learn of Me."
&lt;/b&gt;

Remember, this description of Jesus Christ is THE ONLY true and accurate description of Who He is. But let us not be content with a mere academic understanding of these truths. May The Spirit of God grant unto a an understanding of Who Jesus is that stirs us up to worship Him more passionately, to serve Him with a deeper joy and to share the gospel that bears His Name with a love and boldness that glorifies His Name.

God is not honored by ignorance of Him. We are living in a day and age of spiritual deception, and the blurring of clear Bible truth. Many people are being deceived by the religious rhetoric that comes from world religions and pseudo Christian cults like LDS and JWs who masquerade themselves as followers of Jesus Christ.

When a Mormon, or a JW, or a Hindu or a Muslim tells you that they believe in Jesus Christ, what they are saying is that they believe that an historical figure named Jesus existed. As you probe for more information about Jesus Christ, they will refer you to their inspired literature because the Bible is outdated and inaccurate. Then they will tell you who they really think Jesus is according the The Book or Mormon, or the JW NWT, or the Hindu Vedas or the Koran.

Satan is the author of confusion, for if you put together what all of these religious groups say about Jesus, here is what you come up with: He is a man who is divine but not God, He is the spirit brother of Lucifer, but he is not a devil. Because He was a disillusioned individual, He went up to the Himalayas and through transcendental meditation, He discovered that He was the Christ. Yes, there was someone who hung on the cross of Calvary, but it wasnt Jesus Christ. Blasphemy!!!

By saying what I just said should not be interpreted to mean that I hate the people who are a part of these religious groups. Not at all! I am simply seeking to speak the truth in love and warn you as an under shepherd of Jesus Christ about these people who are talking about another Jesus and another gospel which is NOT true.

If you tell me that 2+2+5 and I tell you that 2+2=4, does that mean that I hate you? Of course not. It is the love of Christ that compels us to tell the truth.&lt;img title="More..." alt="" src="/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /&gt;

Okay, back to verse 15. In response to the false teachers that challenged the true nature and deity of Jesus Christ, the Spirit of God writes:

Jesus Christ &lt;b&gt;is (1) the image of the invisible God, (2) the firstborn of every creature:&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God, meaning by this, that it is in Jesus alone that God, who is otherwise invisible, is manifested to us, in accordance with what is said in &lt;b&gt;John 1:18, No man hath ever seen God: the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath himself manifested him to us.&lt;/b&gt;

Christ is called the image of God on this ground  that he makes The Father, Who is Spirit, in a manner visible to us.

&lt;b&gt;John14:8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? &lt;/b&gt;

Jesus Christ is &lt;b&gt;the image of the invisible God&lt;/b&gt; not only because He is man made in the image of God (&lt;b&gt;Gen. 1:2627; 1 Cor. 11:7&lt;/b&gt;), but also because he has the same nature as God (&lt;b&gt;Heb. 1:3&lt;/b&gt;), being co-eternal with him.

&lt;b&gt;Heb 1.3 being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Php 2:6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily (Col 2.10). &lt;/b&gt;

It is in Jesus Christ alone, that we may behold The Living God as in a mirror. For in Jesus Christ, we see a revelation of the righteousness, love, goodness, wisdom and power of God in human form. &lt;i&gt;This is great news&lt;/i&gt;. When it comes to God, if you want to know who God is, if you want to know what Hes like, if you want to know what His tone is, how He behaves, how He feels, how He responds, you dont have to speculate, you dont have to play childrens games; you can find out. You study, you look at and you watch Jesus Christ. Jesus is the image of the invisible God.

Jesus Christ is the exact imprint of the nature and glory of God, which means if you want to know who God is, if you want to know what Gods like, if you want to know how Hell respond to you, if you want to know what His tone is, if you want to know what stirs up anger in Him, where He extends mercy, you have to look at the person of Jesus Christ. If you want to know who God is, Jesus is the key. To know the nature and character of God, you go to Jesus Christ. If you go anywhere else, youre going to get off. We know about the nature and character of God through the person and work of Jesus Christ.

&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; Christ pre-existed with the Father before the world was created as &lt;b&gt;the first-born over all creation&lt;/b&gt;. The word "&lt;b&gt;firstborn&lt;/b&gt;" (see definition 4416) comes from the Greek word &lt;i&gt;prototokos&lt;/i&gt; and signifies "&lt;i&gt;preeminence&lt;/i&gt;" rather than first in order of birth being the Fathers heir. This phrase does not refer to the creating of Jesus Christ before the rest of creation, as the Arians and the Unitarians teach, but &lt;i&gt;to His eternal divine existence&lt;/i&gt;. Firstborn here refers to His preeminent state above all of creation, because He is Lord of all creation.

In verse 18, we will see that Jesus is called the &lt;b&gt;first-begotten from the dead&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; it is by Him, the Resurrection and the Life that we all rise again.

Jesus is the express image of the invisible God. He is not some distant, inferior reflection of God. He is not simply divine. He is not simply an avatar. Jesus is the Great I AM! The Mighty God from everlasting to everlasting.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;16 For (1) by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ is the Agent is all creation. &lt;b&gt;For by him all things were created.&lt;/b&gt; This shows that all things owe their origin to Jesus Christ. He is the divine agent in Creation and made all that we see and all that we do not see. He created matter and spirit. This is a restatement of His deity and a declaration of his glorious power.

The Trinity was active in the work of Creation (&lt;b&gt;Gen. 1:1&lt;/b&gt;; Heb &lt;i&gt;elohim, &lt;/i&gt;speaks of a compound unity, not absolute oneness). The words &lt;b&gt;by him&lt;/b&gt; show that God the Father works by the Son. Everything in this physical, visible universe came into being out of nothing by His power (&lt;b&gt;Heb. 11:3; John 1:3&lt;/b&gt;).

&lt;b&gt;All things&lt;/b&gt;  created that are in heaven and  earth includes the whole of the spiritual creation, angels and archangels; and the whole of physical crecreation, angels and archangels; and the whole of physical creation, visible and invisible.

Listed here are some of the things we dont see with our natural eyes: &lt;b&gt;thrones or dominions or principalities or powers&lt;/b&gt;. These words describe the world of angels both holy and evil (&lt;b&gt;Col. 2:10, 15; Eph. 1:21, 3:10; 6:12; 1 Cor. 15:24&lt;/b&gt;).

Since the JWs teach that Jesus Christ is a created being who is divine, but not God, this explains why the Jehovahs Witnesses in their New World Translation they felt constrained, for doctrinal reasons, to make the unwarranted addition to the Word of God at this verse by adding other so as to read all other things. The implication of course is that Jesus Himself is a created being as well. Blasphemy!

&lt;b&gt;All things were created through Him and for Him&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus Christ is not only the Agent of all creation, He is the very purpose of all creation. The Bible clearly teaches us that all of creation exists for the Son of God. As mind boggling and glorious creation is, creation itself is not the ultimate, because creation exists for something higher, and that something is the glory of Jesus Christ.

In &lt;b&gt;Romans 8&lt;/b&gt;, we are given a description of things which in the future will reveal Christs glory to all fallen creation at his Second Coming (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:1923&lt;/b&gt;). At the end of time every knee will bow to him as Lord (&lt;b&gt;Phil. 2:10&lt;/b&gt;) and there will be a wedding feast when Jesus will possess all things (&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:116&lt;/b&gt;).

Let me say this about things that are invisible before we move on. People make two errors when it comes to spiritual forces. They either make way too much of them or they dont consider them enough. Those are the two big errors. There really are angels and there really are demons. There really are spiritual authorities and spiritual powers. All were created by Christ and they all also obey Him.

Jesus Christ has all authority over all angelic beings, good and bad. Do not believe lie that Satan and Jesus are opposites. Satan is a created being with limited powers and authority. In fact, in &lt;b&gt;Revelation 20&lt;/b&gt;, another created angel lays hold of and binds Satan in the pit for 1,000 years.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;17 And (1) he is before all things, and (2) by him all things consist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We see here the glory of Christ in His pre-existence. &lt;b&gt;He is before all things and in him all things consist&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus was not part of Creation but He was before it. The Nicene Creed (A.D. 325) says &lt;i&gt;there never was a time when he was not&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;(1) He is before all things. John 1.1-3&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; The word consists here means, "&lt;i&gt;continue, endure, exist, hold together&lt;/i&gt;". This literally means that Jesus is the power that binds the universe together. The only reason the planets and stars follow their prescribed orbit is because He holds them in place. The only reason the molecules that make up our bodies, and the world around us dont fly off into space is because He holds it all together! Dont think for a minute that we dont need Him! He is sovereign over the entire universe which He has created! It is Jesus Christ that is giving you and me our very next breath!

The doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ from eternity is taught in several places (&lt;b&gt;John 1:1; 8:58; 17:5; 2 Cor. 8:9&lt;/b&gt;). He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last (&lt;b&gt;Rev. 22:13&lt;/b&gt;). He did not pre-exist in human form but became man at the Incarnation (&lt;b&gt;Phil. 2:68&lt;/b&gt;), Emmanuel, God with us.

Everything is held together and sustained by him (&lt;b&gt;Heb. 1:13&lt;/b&gt;). Through Him the cosmos is prevented from falling into chaos and the principle of coherence (unity) is found in him. The only thing that can hold your marriage together, your life together, your family together is The Lord Jesus Christ.thus, if any of those things are falling apart this morning, the Only One that can put you back together is a full blown, no nonsense commitment to Jesus.

&lt;b&gt;Jesus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Christ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Is God&lt;/b&gt;

Which is why the writer of &lt;b&gt;Hebrews 1&lt;/b&gt; can take &lt;b&gt;Psalm 102:25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;27&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;which refers to God the Creator&lt;/i&gt;, and apply it to the Sonfor the Son is God. So he says in verses
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands. 11 They will perish, but thou remainest, and they all will become old as a garment, 12 and as a mantle thou wilt roll them up, as a garment they will also be changed. But thou art the same, and thy years will not come to an end."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ is the Creator of the universe. He is God. He is to be worshipped.

&lt;b&gt;All things were created by Him and for Him&lt;/b&gt;

Beloved, we were created for His pleasure, not ours (&lt;b&gt;Rev 4.11&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 11:36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We are transformed from one degree of glory to the next by beholding God. How do you behold God? WE behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

&lt;b&gt;Jesus is Lord over the New Creation&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Ti 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Php 2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ, The Lord of all creation, became a man in order that through His perfect and sinless life, He would provide through the shedding of His blood on the cross, the one and only acceptable sacrifice for sin forever. Sin is a debt that man cannot pay, thus Jesus the Creator died for His creation, Jesus the sinless One died for sinners, Jesus the righteous One died for the unrighteous, Jesus the godly One for the ungodly, Jesus the holy One or the unholy. But atonement accomplished is not to be interpreted as atonement automatically to me apart from faith in Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is the difference between religion and the gospel of Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Religions says, Forgive your brother, feed the poor and be a better person, then you and God can talk. The gospel says, Come to Me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Its not, Clean up, then come, but rather, Come when youre tired and come when youre weary. Come now, and I will give you rest. Come to Me.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

God is not in love with some future version of you. Do you understand that? Hes not in love with some future version of you. Youre not in time-out right now. Hes not like, One day, you and I will get together and chat, but for now, to be honest with you, you bother Me. So four or five years from now, were going to be tight, but right now youve just got way too many issues to be in My throne room. Thats now how this works. He says, &lt;b&gt;Come to Me now, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus IS Lord, but He is not your Lord until you repent of your sin and self righteousness and turn to Him and Him alone for salvation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:2 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Come as you are, and come now.

In our next post, Pastor Ben Hiwale is going to pick up where we left off. God has blessed this body with many gifted teachers.

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Supremacy of Jesus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Pastor Ben Hiwale

How big is your God? If you think your God is small and helpless then you will live differently than you if you believe that He is great, gentle, gracious and good. One the problems we have as Christians is that we think our God is too small. We dont think he can completely handle our issues, He maybe is all powerful and all knowing for others but not for you, and as a direct result of that we get anxious, sad, timid, scared. Remember the movie &lt;em&gt;Honey I shrunk the Kids&lt;/em&gt;? At times Church, it seems, we have shrunk God. If you live with a small God, your life is filled with anxiety, everything depends on you, and your emotions are dependent on your circumstances. You dont trust anyone, cant be generous. Since you have to take care of yourself, your acceptance by others is more important to you than your willingness to help or influence. You remain self centered because your God is not big enough to help, reward or punish. When we shrink our God, we end up with faithless prayer, benign worship, joyless service, self-centered love, hopelessness, unforgiveness and a life filled with fear.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

In Colossians, Jesus was seen as one of many gods in the Pantheon of the Roman gods. Gnosticism ruled they could not bring themselves to believe that God could become man, because they believed that matter was evil. Their view of God was small. What is your view of Jesus today? What size is he?

This text is primarily a Christological passage of the New Testament. This is one of those passages that strikes you as beautiful, deep and rich but you have hardly any idea of how deep it is until you get deep into studying it. There is so much in this passage that we can do a mini-series on these verses. As I prepared to preach this message, I feel like the mosquito at the nudist colony, so much good stuff, where do I begin? As we walk through it, I want to give you some observations to help us see the beauty of this passage and then draw out a few of the implications that are in there for you and me.

&lt;a title="Colossians Video" href="https://vimeo.com/64520516"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-204 alignright" alt="pastorbenvideo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorbenvideo-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the westwe often think that God is a means to a better life, family, purpose, guilt free living or even eternity in heaven. As if God existed for us and we not for Him.Thinking of God that way is fundamentally wrong.  Repentance is not merely adding God to our lives, repentance is living like all that we do and all we are exists for God. He is the center of everything. This is more than just adding God into your life; its a complete re-orientation of who you are.
&lt;h3&gt;The Supremacy of Jesus Over His New Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
Jesus is paramount over everything that He has created in verses 15-17 and Hes preeminent over all that He has redeemed in verses 18-23. Another way to say it is that He has first place over both the cosmos and the church. He is Lord of everything He has made and He is Lord over everyone He has saved.

In verse 18 the reference to firstborn is the resurrection from the dead. Jesus died on the sixthday of the week, which is the same day man had been created, which is the same day the Genesis account presents that man had sinned. Jesus died on the sixthday showing that he was ushering in the end of first creation, Jesus was raised on the first day of the next week ushering in the new creation. In the Gospel of John 20:22, it tells how after the Resurrection, the first time Jesus saw his disciples he did something very strange. He breathed on them. Which is a strange thing to do when you see someone after a while.

When he did that, he said to them, receive the Holy Spirit. What is happening is  Jesus was beginning this new creation. He was starting this resurrected community that we know as the church. Jesus is the head of the new creation and the source from which it all flows.Later they would receive the spirit in full in Acts 2.His embodiment of the new creation is the church. The church is Gods display of the glories of the new creation. It is where the power of spirit is making a new resurrected order within the church. It is where he showcases the beauties of the resurrected life.

Verse 19 - He is displaying Trinity  we see God in 3 parts. He is saying the fullness of God was in Jesus, in experiencing Him you experience the full Godhead. Which is why Jesus said in John 14:23  when the Holy Spirit comes and resides in you, so does the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. In other words, all 3 members are in every single one of them. If your head is starting to explode then you are getting a hang of this.

Verse 20 - Here is the turn in this passage. When we rebelled against God, Paul says, the God who existed before all things and the God who spoke all things into existence through His word.rather than smashing us out of existence, He left the glories of heaven and took upon Himself our penalty and reconciled us to Himself. The cross was bloody, Paul says. The cross was gruesome because our sin was utterly wicked before the face of God. Jesus in his death on the Cross was absorbing the wrath and penalty of God towards creation so that every single ounce of penalty due to us was put on the cross. The reason blood grosses us out is because sin grosses God out. That is why the cross was what it was because our sin was what it was. Sometimes the utter majesty of the Cross is lost on us.

How does this passage apply to us today? Let me try to make two simple points and present couple questions and applications as we continue to unpack this. We can summarize this passage this way:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Knowing and Loving Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gospel  Only Way to Love Jesus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knowing and Loving Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
Paul says the point of salvation is knowing and loving Jesus, that Jesus would be pre-eminent. Our original sin was idolatry. We loved something, treasured something, we prioritized something more than God. Paul says in Romans 1:23, our original sin was that we worshipped and served the creature, more than the creator.

When you love creation rather than the Creator, you're trying to get from creation what creation cannot give you. You're going to hit a ceiling and grow frustrated and be forced to medicate. Some of us are going to medicate with drugs and alcohol. Some of us are going to medicate with sex. Some of us are going to medicate with lust. Most of us are going to medicate with trinkets and toys. In the Garden of Eden, we see idolatry, false worship. Sometimes people have a hard time seeing that. I dont see them bowing down or worshipping the tree. No they worshipped it because they deemed it more fundamental to their lives than the presence of God. So they turned their back on the presence of God and chose the tree, and that is idolatry. So every sin from this point on also springs from idolatry, where you and I treasure and prioritize something else rather than God.

If the essence of our sin is Idolatry; then the essence of repentance as it says 1 Thessalonians 1:9  to turn from our idolatry back to the living God. But for many people God is a means to an end. He is the best way to a better life now or better family, or better finances, or health or eternity in heaven. You dont use God for a means to anything. He himself is the great prize. All the service for God means nothing to God if it is done in pursuit of anything else but God himself. All the zeal for God means nothing to God if it is done for any other reason but God himself. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, I can make more sacrifices than anyone, give my body to be burnt, how can be more radical than that. Paul says I can have all the spiritual gifting and converse in every possible language on earth and in heaven and if I dont have love in my heart, it doesnt really matter because God is not pleased with it. If anything he is insulted by it. This creates the dilemma of Colossians chapter 1.

How can we learn to love God if the essence of coming to God is loving God and making him pre-eminent? Love cannot be commanded. Isnt that the irony of the great commandment? How do you command someone to love someone else. Can you imagine if your parents put a girl or guy in front of you and said  love her or him. You will be like, who are you? You cant command someone to love. Love is a response. When I met Teresa and fell in love with her, it was a response to her beauty. The more I have gotten to know her over the years, the more I love her because love is a response to delighting in something, it is a response to a character of something.

How can we love God, it is the great commandment, how can we be commanded to love God and yet have it be generated from our heart, where it is to achieve no other end than God himself. The answer Paul says is in the Gospel.
&lt;h3&gt;Gospel  Only Way to Love Jesus&lt;/h3&gt;
The Gospel is the only place we can learn to love Jesus. Paul gives us a breathtaking portrait of Jesus and his work. But dont miss the context. He says all this after telling them in verse 9 that they be filled with the knowledge of His will and they have spiritual understanding, endurance and perseverance, Notice verse 22, we will be presented holy and blameless and above reproach if (verse 23) we continue in the faith and hope of the Gospel which is proclaimed to us. Paul was saying, If you are truly saved, and built on the solid foundation of Jesus Christ, then you will continue in the faith and nothing will move you. You have heard the Gospel and trusted Jesus Christ, and He has saved you.

In other words, we are not saved by continuing in the faith. But we continue in the faith and thus prove that we are saved.

Spiritual growth doesnt take place by going beyond the Gospel; Spiritual growth is produced by going deeper into the Gospel. Love for God and love for others, the spiritual fruit is produced in us by seeing Jesus and what he has done by immersing ourselves in the Gospel. Spiritual growth, bearing spiritual fruit, understanding, knowledge of His will, andendurance, those things dont come by going beyond the Gospel, they come by going deeper into the Gospel.

For example, how is physical fruit produced? When a man and woman come together they produced a physical fruit, a child. They are not thinking about the fruit they are producing. They are caught up in a moment of intimacy and love with one another and the fruit of that is the child. People think the way you produce spiritual fruit is by playing Matt Redman songs, having quiet time every day, telling yourself to love, love, love. You dont produce spiritual fruit by thinking about it and pursuing it, you produce spiritual fruit by being swept up in an intimate spiritual adoration and worship of Jesus Christ and the fruit of that is love, joy, peace, gentleness, longsuffering. Love cannot be really commanded, love is a response to beauty. We see that beauty in the glory of who Jesus is and what he has done in the gospel. That when we are changed. That why it says 1 John 4:19  we love Him because he first loved us.
&lt;h3&gt;What is the Gospel?&lt;/h3&gt;
The more you know and are in touch and immersed in the Gospel, the more love for God or others is produced in you by experiencing the love of God towards you in Christ. So what Paul gives us here is a declaration of what Jesus has done. The Christian Gospel is primarily two things; and we cannot get this wrong.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is an announcement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is a story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
The word Gospel was not an exclusively Christian word or even a religious word when it was first used by the apostles. The word in Greek means" good news". It was often used when Greek generals were in battle. After they won they would send out a "gospel carrier", an evangelist, back to the cities they were protecting to announce the good news: General So-and-So had won the battle and they were free! It was not an invitation to come join the battle; it was an announcement that the battle had been won. So when the word Gospel is used as a description of the message of Jesus and his apostles, what is being implied is that we are not announcing what they are supposed to go and do for God, but primarily we are announcing what God has done for us. God uses that announcement, that story, to change our hearts. God uses the beauty of the story to make Jesus come alive in our hearts. Which is why the Gospel is not primarily what we ought to do for God, but what God has done for us. Seeing what God has done for us gives us the heart to do what we should do for him.

For example - When we want to motivate generosity in the church at large, we use guilt - "look at all those people in India how they are suffering, we should do something to help them!" Or how about, "you give to God and God will multiply and bless you." That is appealing to our greed; if you give to God, you will be rich. Paul uses neither one of these motivations. In 2 Corinthians 8:9 Paul uses neither guilt nor greed, but grace. Guilt and greed may produce a temporary response. God does not want a generous offering, he wants a generous life. That is not produced by a sermon, guilt or greed. It is only the generosity of Christ that produces a generous spirit in you. The Gospel is not just after obedience; it is after a whole new kind of obedience. That is the kind of obedience that does not necessitate a stirring preaching on whatever that subject is, in order to become to what God wants us to become. You can apply this to just about anything when it comes to spiritual fruit.

Another example - Forgiveness  Matthew 18:24  Jesus told a parable that sums up this perfectly. The man who owes another man ten thousand talents. We really dont know the magnitude of this debt. But it was a debt that could not be paid by this guy and in those days, after his death his children and their children will continue to inherit this debt. Time comes to collect that debt and he makes an emotional appeal to the man he is indebted to. Then something happens that must have taken Jesus' hearers by surprise. Jesus uses the word splagma - gut compassion. The man is moved and says, "no I am not going to give you more time, I am going to forgive your entire debt. You are free forever."

The man stands up and for the first in his life he is really free. He runs across the street and immediately crosses paths with a man who owes him a dollar. He grabs the man and demands that he pay him back the dollar. When he cannot pay, he has him thrown in jail. I wonder if the people listening to this story heard that and said, no one who is forgiven 10 thousand talents will hold someone else accountable for one talent. That was Jesus point exactly. If you have trouble forgiving others then you have no concept of the grace of God towards you. And if you have a problem forgiving others, I am not going to beat you up, I want to put you in touch with the generosity of Christ towards you because when you experience the generosity of Christ towards you. it will produce the fruit in you.

Many times we have taken the Bible and preached the Gospel as what we ought to do for God. Our sermons are characterized by commands, read the Bible, be in a small group, live generously. Listen: the law, no matter how eloquently preached, cannot produce change in us. That is why Paul in 1 Corinthians 13 says, it's not like you can be more committed in your obedience, it's not a spiritual experience that you must have, because he could speak in more tongues than anyone. You must have love in your heart. Where does love come from? Love for God comes from experiencing the love and beauty of God, and that happens in the Gospel.

God is not after obedience but a new kind of obedience that is born out of love. I pray that this kind of preaching doesnt sound dangerous to you. Experiencing the Gospel produces the heart that bears spiritual fruit. What He wants and what we want becomes the same. Dont confuse diagnosis in the Bible with prognosis. The Bible diagnosis tons of problems sin, apathy, lovelessness, Gods prognosis is always repentance and faith in the Gospel. Gospel produces in us what the law couldnt. It makes us alive. This is bedrock of the Christian faith. The knowledge that the God who created the universe could not be more favorably disposed to you and He is the only one that matters.

This is what Paul says drives out sin. I have had conversations with people dealing with lust or porn. They will tell me, I cannot turn this off, man. I say, oh but if your wife or child walks in on you, what happens  did you lose your desire in that lust? What just happened is your attraction to lust was driven out by a greater emotion. Many people are trying to bring them into subjection by will power when those things are brought under control by captivation of the higher power, higher beauty. This explosive power is so great that it snatches away all other attractions. We dont learn to bring our bodies under control by deadening our impulses, we bring them under by growing in our passion and love for God, and that happens because of the Gospel. That is how people are changed. That is how spiritual fruit and maturity is produced. How we began in Christ is how we continue. The gospel is not the diving board off which you jump into pool of Christianity; the gospel is the pool itself. The gospel as someone said is not the ABC of Christianity but the A through Z. Notice how we are saved, we are to continue in the faith, steadfast. We are not going beyond the gospel, but going deeper into the Gospel and that is what keeps transforming us.

The parable that is scary to me as a Pastor is of seeds, Luke 8, how some of them sprang up quickly, Here is question: These people are producing fruit and the sun comes out and withers them? Are these saved or unsaved people? They represent unsaved people who for a while looked like saved people, but their roots never went deep enough to choke out the temptation, when it comes. The way you move people from sinners prayer to relationship with Christ  you dont give them 3 steps to do this and 4 steps to overcome that and 5 ways to march up that hill, you do it by driving the Gospel so deep down their heart that it goes beyond the weeds that choke out their attraction to sin. Its deeper into the Gospel.

Maybe the reason it has been difficult for us to engage our culture with this message because we havent fallen in love with the Gospel. Maybe if we looked deep enough we might see that most of our passion is for self-exaltation and not the Glory of Christ.

I am praying for a Revival in Rochester and the surrounding counties. What changes me is not the best life now but the glory of the Gospel.
&lt;h3&gt;Practical Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
Given that God is good, great and gentle,how should we live?We should live in:

&lt;strong&gt;Authentic Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;  No need for image control, no need to live a lie. Brokenness will never be fixed unless we live in an Authentic Relationship with him. Live in forgiveness. Otherwise you will forever be using external things to medicate a restlessness in you that is robbing you from all that Christ has come to grant you in the Gospel.

&lt;strong&gt;Selfless Service&lt;/strong&gt; Our God serves everyone. We dont serve because of a need, it's not about guilt, you serve because that is who our God is and that is what you are. He gave himself to be a ransom. Take a step today! Rows are good but circles are better  creates accountability, flourishes your gifts.

&lt;strong&gt;Passionate Evangelism&lt;/strong&gt;  Share the Gospel  its the good news.Your walk with Jesus is not private, it may be personal. You are the light and salt  Light always shines and salt always preservers. Invite people to Church with you, those that are far from God to the most meaningful event you do every weekend in your life. Allow the Gospel to transform

&lt;strong&gt;Faith Filled Prayer&lt;/strong&gt;  I am tired of benign prayer. Our heart is not in prayer. We dont ask weightlifters to pick up pencils, why do we ask God for sunny days, as if that is all he can do? Hebrews 13:5-6 - I will never leave you or forsake you.

&lt;strong&gt;Awesome Worship&lt;/strong&gt;  Awe-filled worship, not Awful worship. Your God who spoke the world into creations, humbled himself became a man, went on the Cross and made a way for you to be reconciled with Him, He now resides in you  He is great, good, gentle  How shall you live?
&lt;h3&gt;Two Questions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. How is your love for Jesus? Is Jesus pre-eminent to you or your life, career, finances or some pursuit pre-eminent to you?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2. When was the last time you were deeply moved to tears by the Gospel?&lt;/strong&gt;

What is going to change us, our situation is not some 5 steps of this or that but the billion steps God took towards me to rescue me. Ephesians 5:25 says, remember how Christ loved you. In a lecture you leave with information, in a motivational speech you leave with action steps but in a sermon, you leave worshipping. You leave unbelievably fulfilled. It is all about the Cross. The Gospel produces the heart that obeys. Creation was set on a course to Reconciliation because of the Cross.</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>To pick up where Pastor Ben left off in our last post, note carefully that after the wonderful promise of assurance of salvation given unto those who trust in Christ mentioned in earlier passages, in verse 23, Paul inserts the words &lt;b&gt;if you continue in the faith&lt;/b&gt;. That if &lt;i&gt;is not&lt;/i&gt; stating a condition that must be met in order to qualify for salvation. That is stating the reality of &lt;i&gt;genuine, biblical regeneration.&lt;/i&gt;

What this &lt;b&gt;if &lt;/b&gt;means is this. Neither you nor I have any biblical basis upon which to assure &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; who has walked forward here at church or at a crusade but has not continued in the faith that he or she will be presented blameless before The Father.

Yes, there is that eternal security in Christ because whom Christ redeems, He fully redeems and &lt;b&gt;ever lives to make intercession for them&lt;/b&gt;. But the &lt;i&gt;evidence &lt;/i&gt;that I belong to Him is manifested by my continually abiding in Him. &lt;!--more--&gt;There is no eternal security or assurance of salvation outside of an abiding fellowship with The Lord. Read &lt;b&gt;1 Cor 6.9,10 &lt;/b&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Eph 5.3-6.&lt;/b&gt; Paul writes that we cannot continue in the faith and continue in sin at the same time. (&lt;b&gt;Rom 6.1&lt;/b&gt;)

One cannot read the NT epistles of Paul without discovering that he Paul was a deeply devoted, unswervingly determined and Spirit driven follower of Jesus Christ.&lt;a title="Colossians Video" href="https://vimeo.com/65058635"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

He was &lt;i&gt;devoted&lt;/i&gt; to Jesus Christ at any cost. He was &lt;i&gt;determined&lt;/i&gt; to fulfill the call of God upon his life. He had a &lt;i&gt;Spirit driven&lt;/i&gt; desire to please His Master by proclaiming the gospel to the lost, and seeing people turned into disciples of Jesus Christ.

To a vast majority of church people today, they would say that Paul was an extreme example of what it means to follow Jesus Christ. But Paul himself exhorted the saints in Corinth to &lt;b&gt;follow him, as he followed Christ. &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The modern church person is afraid of extremism to the point where we are guilty of the worst extremism of all, the extremism of impotence. &lt;/i&gt;Pastor Vance Havner
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 1:24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul has just finished talking about the completed redemption and reconciling work of The Lord Jesus Christ, so he &lt;i&gt;is not saying&lt;/i&gt; that the afflictions he was experiencing added anything to the finished work of Jesus in His death, burial and resurrection.

What he is speaking about the &lt;i&gt;inevitable sufferings&lt;/i&gt; that all saints suffer for the Name and cause of Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There are the sufferings of persecution. &lt;b&gt;2 Tim 3.12; Matt 5.10-12.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There are the sufferings in the flesh as we, by the Spirit, mortify those deeds of the flesh in the pursuit of holiness. &lt;b&gt;Rom 6,8;1 Pet 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Cor 1.5 &amp;amp;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Phil 3 &lt;/b&gt;talk about the &lt;b&gt;sufferings of Christ&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;fellowship of His sufferings&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participating in the sufferings of Christ is a spiritual experience which is born out of the believers union with Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Like the early Apostles, Paul rejoiced that he was &lt;b&gt;counted worthy to suffer shame for His name (Acts 5:41)&lt;/b&gt;. A Christian should never suffer as a thief or as an evildoer; but it is an honor to &lt;b&gt;suffer as a Christian (1 Peter 4:1516).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Scriptures teach us the best way of living, the noblest way of suffering and the most comfortable way of dying&lt;/i&gt;. -- John Flavel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explanation about sufferings&lt;/h3&gt;
Now some people in the body suffer afflictions because they have made foolish or careless mistakes in the past or even as believers. The issue is not forgiveness, but consequences for the sin.

Others saints may suffer misfortune because of the consequences of living in a fallen world system that has fractured our economic and physical well being. Many godly saints in this body have lost lifes savings due to ungodly men making ungodly decisions in the banking industries. Some precious saints are facing critical physical issues, not because of sin in their life, but because of sin in the world.

Thank God here is forgiveness for all of our foolish sins when we humble ourselves under His mighty hand. Thank God for His very present help and comfort in unexpected or unforeseen times of trouble.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;stewardship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul was made a minister of the gospel (&lt;b&gt;Col 1.23,25&lt;/b&gt;) of which he was a steward. Pauls calling as a steward was 2-fold &lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;for the benefit of others &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;for the glory of God.&lt;/i&gt;

Paul will tell us in verse 29 that he labored to develop his gift and fulfill the call of God upon his life. Paul attributed the ability to minister to the grace of God. &lt;b&gt;1Cor 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&lt;/b&gt;

Paul of course is speaking of His ascension ministry gift and calling of God to be an &lt;i&gt;apostle, teacher and evangelist&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Eph 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.&lt;/b&gt;
Please note that the purpose of all of the ascension ministry gifts are &lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;for the maturing of the saints&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;for the work of the ministry.&lt;/i&gt;

Christianity is not a spectator sport, where a few of God's people in the church serve, and the rest come and get a bulletin, and then go home and eat popcorn, and drink Coke or Pepsi and watch from the grandstands.

God has given to each and every one of us gifts and talents. These talents are listed in &lt;b&gt;Romans 12 &lt;/b&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;b&gt;1Cor 12.&lt;/b&gt;The gifts listed in &lt;b&gt;Romans 12&lt;/b&gt; are prophecy, serving, teaching, exhorting, giving, ruling or overseeing and mercy.

In &lt;b&gt;1 Cor 12, &lt;/b&gt;there are listed the charismata or divine giftings that are spontaneous, like the &lt;b&gt;word of knowledge &lt;/b&gt;or &lt;b&gt;the word of wisdom. &lt;/b&gt;But at the end of that chapter, we find listed a few more of the &lt;i&gt;motivational &lt;/i&gt;gifts like &lt;b&gt;teaching, helps &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;administration.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1Pet 4.10,11&lt;/b&gt; tell us that we, we are responsible to stir these gifts up and used them &lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;to buildup he rest of the body&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;to bring glory to God&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 4.2 &lt;/b&gt;tells us that as stewards, each one of us are called to be faithful to their gifting and callings for which we will be held accountable to God. Remember the teaching of Jesus about the person who hides their talent under a bushel? We are responsible for the development and use of these gifts.Your spiritual gift is that irresistible something inside of you that drives you to do what you do.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Are you using your God given gift in this body? Are you continually looking for ways to stir up that gift to bless others and bring glory to God?

It is our prayer and goal as the leadership here at Koinonia Fellowship to see every single person who calls this their home church to be involved in some way throughout the week..Children Ministry, Greeters Ministry, Hospitality Ministry, Worship Ministry, Nursing Home Ministry, Fathers Heart Ministry, Prison Ministry, Prayer Ministry, Hospital Visitation Ministry, Sound and Media Ministry.

If you have a gift or service that you would like to offer to the body here that we are not aware of, Id like you to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GY86X3G"&gt;click this link&lt;/a&gt; and tell us!

One very important thing to keep in mind about the operation of these gifts within the church, and that is the motive. According to &lt;b&gt;1 Cor 13,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;the only acceptable motive for serving The Lord in the eyes of The Father is a love for His Son and a desire to please Him and bring Him glory.&lt;/i&gt;

The use of the gifts within the church is not to be a talent show or a spiritual Olympics, but a celebration of the goodness, grace and mercy of being accepted in Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A mystery in Scripture refers to something that was hidden in days gone by, which has now been revealed or made known by The Spirit. In the NT we read about the mysteries of &lt;b&gt;the kingdom of God (Mk 4.11). &lt;/b&gt;The mystery of national Israels &lt;b&gt;partial blindness &lt;/b&gt;until the purchased possession of the church is completed (&lt;b&gt;Rom 11.25). &lt;/b&gt;The mystery of &lt;b&gt;God manifest in the flesh (1 Tim 3.16). &lt;/b&gt;The mystery of &lt;b&gt;iniquity (2 Thess 2.7). &lt;/b&gt;Mystery Babylon (&lt;b&gt;Rev 17).&lt;/b&gt;

According to the parallel passage in &lt;b&gt;Ephesians 3:1-6&lt;/b&gt;, the mystery that Paul is speaking about here is the hidden mystery of the joining together of Jewish and Gentile in the Body of The Messiah.

Jesus Christ came to earth, was rejected by His people, and was crucified. He arose again and returned to heaven. Did this mean that Gods promised kingdom for Israel was now abandoned? No, because God had initiated a new programHis mysterythat was not explained by the Old Testament prophets. The mystery is that today God is uniting Jews and Gentiles in the church (&lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:1122&lt;/b&gt;). When the church is completed, then Jesus Christ will return and take His people to heaven (&lt;b&gt;1 Thes. 4:1318&lt;/b&gt;). Then He will again deal with Israel as a nation and establish the promised kingdom (&lt;b&gt;Acts 15:1218&lt;/b&gt;). The present church age is a parenthetical period of time between the 69th and 70th week of Daniel.

One of the most important things to remember when studying the Bible, and in particular Bible prophecy is this. The church is not Israel, and Israel is not the church.

The false teachers used this word &lt;b&gt;mystery&lt;/b&gt; to describe the inner secrets that were hidden in their literature that contained the revelation of their belief system. The false teachers exalted themselves and their great hidden spiritual truths that only the enlightened could understand. They preached a very heady and complicated message of spirituality, but Paul preached Christ Jesus The Lord. The Gnostics preached philosophy and the empty traditions of men (&lt;b&gt;Col. 2:8&lt;/b&gt;), but Paul proclaimed Jesus Christ. The false teachers had lists of elaborate rules and regulations that needed to be kept in order to reach a place of spiritual enlightenment (&lt;b&gt;Col. 2:16, 2021&lt;/b&gt;), but Paul presented Christ.

The mystery of the gospel is not a &lt;i&gt;secret society massage &lt;/i&gt;as some religious groups like the Masons or the LDS have. It is a message that is to be proclaimed to the whole world and is offered to every creature until Christ returns.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The mystery mentioned here is &lt;b&gt;Christ in you, the hope of glory. &lt;/b&gt;That these earthen vessels or clay pots can be the dwelling place of the risen Christ, is indeed a blessed mystery!

&lt;b&gt;1Tim 1.1&lt;/b&gt; Jesus alone is our hope.
&lt;b&gt;1Pet 1.3&lt;/b&gt; Jesus alone is our lively or living hope.
&lt;b&gt;Heb 3.6,7&lt;/b&gt; Jesus alone is the source of confidence and joyful hope.
&lt;b&gt;Heb 6.10,11&lt;/b&gt; Jesus alone is our anchor of hope.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul not only sought to &lt;b&gt;preach&lt;/b&gt; the gospel to every creature under heaven (&lt;b&gt;Col 1.23: Mark 16.15&lt;/b&gt;), he also labored along with the power of The Holy Ghost to &lt;b&gt;warn &lt;/b&gt;people of the consequences of rejecting the gospel and &lt;b&gt;teach&lt;/b&gt; them the Word of God in order to make disciples of every creature.

&lt;b&gt;Every man&lt;/b&gt; is repeated 3 times here, in order to emphasize the &lt;i&gt;universality of the Gospel against the intellectual exclusiveness&lt;/i&gt; as was taught by the false teachers.
Progressive growth in grace and spiritual maturity, not sinless perfection, is the will of God for every person who has truly been regenerated by the Holy Ghost (&lt;b&gt;Titus 3.5&lt;/b&gt;).

Please note that Paul &lt;b&gt;labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. &lt;/b&gt;Mom and Dad that which you will most effectively communicate to your kids &lt;i&gt;is that which works in you&lt;/i&gt;. Sunday-school teacher, youth worker, home group leader&lt;i&gt;what will ultimately be fruitful in your ministry is that which has personally been practically worked in and through life by the power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/i&gt;

Never believe that the gospel is what introduces you into the kingdom, and from there on, you are on your own. We never grow out of the gospel beloved, we grow &lt;i&gt;in &lt;/i&gt;the gospel, for it is by growing in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the gospel of Jesus Christ that we obtain &lt;b&gt;wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption: that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. (1 Cor 1.30,31).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whatis the hope of the salvation?&lt;/h3&gt;
All of us will be living in either heaven or hell a billion years from now. My friends, &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;is the hope of the salvation of your eternal soul this morning? Once you answer that, answer this question, &lt;i&gt;what is the basis of that confidence&lt;/i&gt;?

If you are reading this and all of this talk about mystery and heaven and hell has your heart and mind spinning like a top, let me make it real simple for you. The Lord Jesus Christ gives to all sinners that come to Him by faith full assurance of forgiveness of sin and hope (&lt;b&gt;Col 2.2; 6,7&lt;/b&gt;). He dwells in our hearts by faith, and in light of what He has already accomplished for the propitiation of our sins, you are urged to place your faith in Him this morning.All the weight of having to be perfect in order to be right before God has vanished in a second in the weight of the truth of the gospel. You see salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone or is doesnt happen.it is all of God or it doesnt work.</ns3:encoded>

	&lt;li&gt;2.1 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Paul was a man that had a shepherds heart. He was driven by the love of Christ, as well as a God given concern for the spiritual welfare of the saints in Colossae, Laodicea and for those who had never met him face to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We see here that Paul is experiencing great conflict. The Greek word for conflict carries the idea of agony or concern. And the cause of Pauls agony stems from the false teachers and their enticing, philosophical, legalistic and mystical teachings that are so vividly recorded in verse 4,8 and 16-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Laodicea you recall was one of the Seven Churches that Jesus wrote to in the book of Revelation. That letter reveals that about 30-35 years after this letter was sent to them, the spiritual condition of the church was lukewarm, with Jesus Himself standing on the outside and looking in. Only God knows how much impact the false teachings mentioned in this epistle had in their slow but gradual drifting away from the faith once delivered unto the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What does it mean to be lukewarm? Tepid, lacking conviction; halfhearted. There have been times when the question is asked, Are those that are lukewarm saved? Or are they the tares amongst the wheat? My only response is this; I certainly do not find any comfort or assurance in the words of Jesus, I will spew you out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let me ask you, is your commitment to Jesus Christ lukewarm? Im not asking if you feel lukewarm, because we all feel lukewarm at times. To avoid becoming lukewarm, it is vital for us to make a quality decision to follow and obey Jesus, whether you feel like it or not, in season or out of season. A true disciple never wants to be on the wrong side of obedience or compromise....you obey, and deal with the consequences of obedience as they come.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Remember what Jesus said to those people who told Him that they would follow Him, but they wanted to do something else first. Beloved, anybody that puts anything or anyone before Jesus is not a disciple. Jesus Christ will cause disturbance and discomfort in your lifeyou can count on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.2 That their hearts might be comforted (Our God is The God of all comfort), being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Paul's prayer was that the hearts of these believers would be knit together in love. Paul is going to tell these congregations in chapter 3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This love that Paul talks about here contains a practical and doctrinal element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Practically speaking, this love for one another is a comforting love. It is a comforting love because it is the overflow of a love for our Savior Jesus Christ. Thus it is the love of Christ flowing in and through our hearts that knits us together. It is a love that is gentle, humble, kind. It is a love that encourages, exhorts, warns, reproves. It is a love that forgives. It is a love that prefers others and esteems others better than themselves. It is a love that motivates us to serve one another for the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But this love is also rooted in doctrine, or what we believe. A full assurance of understanding of the mystery of God, and of The Father, and of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Our bond of holy unity beloved is the truth of God. The greatest asset in withstanding selfishness within the body and false teaching is a full assurance of the Biblical understanding of the truth about the redemptive mission of Jesus Christ and the amazing love of The Father in providing for us the saving grace and forgiveness of our sin through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The richest and most fulfilled individuals and congregations are those whose hearts are knit together in the love of Jesus, with a full assurance of the biblical truth of what it means to be accepted in The Beloved who as a result of this are walking in the comfort of The Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Full assurance is what the gospel gives to those who embrace Christ. The message of assurance of salvation is the biblical gospel of salvation by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. And the emphasis is on ALONE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a day and age of rampant godless philosophies and theories of evolution, the Holy Spirit tells us that in Christ, God has hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Paul challenged the haughty intellectuals and mystics of his day with the bold claim that Jesus Christ sums up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, for which he was ridiculed and, mocked. Truly, there is nothing new under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is important for us to know that not all wisdom is godly wisdom. James 3.15 tells us that there is a "wisdom" that descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 2 Cor 1.12 talks about fleshly wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Concerning secular, worldly wisdom, the Holy Spirit tells us 1 Cor 3.19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is in Jesus Christ that a person is given this wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Cor 1:24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Cor.30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As we grow in the word of God by reading it and most importantly applying it to our lives, we grow in the wisdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile (deceive) you with enticing words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One sure characteristic of false teachers, be they religious or secular, are their clever and often slick attempts to beguile us from the simplicity that is in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Cor 11.3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eph 4:14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heb 13:9 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Clueless believers are easy prey for clever charlatans. All spiritual deception is the activity of seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, we engage all the lies of the enemy, be they religious or secular with the truth of Scripture. "Thus saith The Lord" and "It is written" MUST be a part of your daily spiritual disciplines if you intend to grow in the Lord, and stand against the wiles of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Co 2:1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The words order and steadfastness are military terms that describe an army that is solidly united against the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The word "order" describes the arrangement of the army in ranks, with each soldier in his proper place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The word "steadfastness" pictures the soldiers in battle formation, presenting a solid front to the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not everybody can be a five-star general, but the general could never fight the battle alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the things that we learn here beloved is that our strength in spiritual warfare is not only personal, but corporate. Beware of adopting the idea that I can do church as a lone ranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus Christ redeemed us to bring order and stability in our lives, not chaos. Beloved, there will never be order in our personal lives, our families and our church family apart from personal and corporate subordination to headship of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Paul rejoiced when he heard of their order and steadfast faith in Christ in the midst of false teachings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over and over, the Scriptures liken the Christian life to a walk. Were told to walk in light (Ephesians 5:8), in love (Ephesians 5:2), in wisdom (Colossians 4:5). And here we are told to walk in Christ the same way we originally received Christby faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The heretics in Pauls day and today will always seek to undermine the great salvation that we have by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As we will see later on in this chapter, false teachers always make salvation a matter of jumping through religious hoops like the observing holy days, eating or not eating certain foods. In other words, any false teaching makes salvation a synergistic combination of Gods grace and mans works. But the Scriptures clearly declare that by grace are you saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast (Eph 2.8, 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, how did you receive Jesus Christ as Lord? Poor in spirit, broken and crushed over the weight of guilt and sorrow for your sin. You come to Christ repentant and spiritually bankrupt, like the publican in the temple, God be merciful to me a sinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.7 Rooted (in the Vine) and built (in the Foundation) up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Note that Gods purpose of the gift of teaching and the teaching ministry mentioned in Ephesians 4 and Romans 12 is so that the saints through the teaching of the word would be rooted and built up in Jesus, established in the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We are to be rooted in the Vine, Jesus Christ, and built upon the solid Foundation of Jesus Christ, the Cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus said, In the volume of the book, it is written of Me....the grand message of Scripture is personal intimacy with the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Pauls ongoing prayer was that I may know Him. Paul would elsewhere write these words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eph 3.17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love. When we are rooted and grounded in Jesus, we will be rooted and grounded in His love.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eph 4.15,16The goal of all teaching is that by speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Peters final exhortation to the church was to grow in grace and in the knowledge of Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Pe 3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Please note that the fruit of being rooted and built up in Jesus is in order that we will be abounding with thanksgiving. There is a connection between being thankful and being whole. (Luke 17; 10 lepers). Faith grows in the hothouse of thanksgiving beloved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Colossians 2.8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beware. Be on ones guard. Beloved, when God says to beware of something, we best take heed to His admonition. Beware means that this is a danger. This is something that needs to be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The word "spoil" here can also be translated kidnapped. This is bottom line of all of the secular worlds academic and religious systems; to kidnap the child of God with their empty philosophies and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Secular and worldly philosophy is really the effort of fallen man to determine apart from the Scriptures the ultimate causes in the earth and the universe. They seek to answer questions like how did the universe come about? Why was I born? What is my purpose in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;From the fall in the garden to the present moment, fallen man has sought to explain the reasons for existence, the purpose of living, and all of the phenomena of the universe. The Holy Spirit calls these worldly philosophies "vain deceit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;They are a baited hook beloved, for at the end of the day, they offer you no real answers, no real help, and ultimately no real hope. The only message that makes any real sense in this senseless world is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The only message that offers any real hope at the graveside of a loved one is the gospel of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By laying aside the Scriptures, people are being kidnapped by the godless theory of evolution...the godless notion that truth is relative or that there is no such thing as absolute truth, to which I would ask the question, is that an absolute statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus Christ is the measure for all human knowledge since He is the Creator and the Sustainer of the universe. Beware of the leaven of secular, unbiblical, worldly philosophy. I am deeply concerned by the increasing number of believers that have embraced the philosophies behind godless, secular counseling. The real answers to the matters of the heart and soul are in Christ, in Whom is hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. The comfort, compassion, guidance and help that we need comes from the Comforter Himself, the Holy Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus Christ and the Word of God is the yardstick by which to measure every human philosophy. By appealing to human religious traditions and worldly philosophies instead of Scripture, many people are being led astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, there are many people like in Pauls day were being taught that salvation was obtained by keeping holy days or other man made traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Peter wrote: 1 Pet 1.18,19 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not all tradition is bad, but there are traditions that are in direct opposition to the teaching of Scripture, listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matt 15.9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Are you following traditions or truth?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In chapter 1 we saw that it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell. (1.19). The fulness of the Godhead is Jesus Christ. Paul here disposes of the Docetic theory that Jesus had no human body as well as the Cerinthian heresy of the separation between the man Jesus and the divine Christ, which is a very common heresy of the New Age movement. He asserts plainly the deity and the humanity of Jesus Christ in physical form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2.10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is one of the foundational truths of Scripture that we need to stand upon. You are complete in Jesus, brothers and sisters. Not in traditions of men. Not in philosophies. You need nothing more. Jesus Christ is our fullness... He is our completeness. By faith in His atoning death and bodily resurrection, we are complete and accepted in the Beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Realizing that my completeness is in Jesus is the armor that frees me from thinking that somehow I am required to do something in order to be saved or that I am missing some religious, esoteric or spiritual experience in life. Realizing that I am complete in Jesus gives rest to my soul and allows me to be thankful and content. (Psa 23.1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The head of all principality and power:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus has authority over all the principalities and powers, which are rankings of angelic beings, both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, in the beginning, when God created the universe there were the cherubim, there were the seraphim, there were the principalities and powers and authorities and dominions, the various rankings of spirit beings. And when Satan, who was one of the highest ranking of spirit beings in God's creation rebelled against God, in the book of Revelation we read that a third of the angels joined in his rebellion. So principalities and powers can refer to the fallen angels, or it can refer to those that are still in obedience unto God. Regardless, Jesus has authority over them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, never think of Satan as being the opposite of God. For God alone is infinite, eternal, omnipotent and Satan is a created being. If you want to look for an opposite of Satan, you should look at Michael or at Gabriel, those angels which remain true to God who have a high ranking or the highest ranking among angels. But never think of Satan as an opposite of God, because you're accrediting him with far more power than he actually has, far more authority than he actually has. He moves within restricted boundaries. God sets the limits of his work. So, all of the principalities and powers are under the authority of Jesus Christ. He is the head or the authority over all principality and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The truth of Col 2.1-10 is as urgent today as it was 2,000 years ago. Perhaps even more urgent in light of the last days prophecies of a great falling away from the faith once delivered to the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Enticing words, traditions of man and godless philosophies abound in our culture. We are living in a post-Christian, anti-Christ, anti-Bible society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But in the midst of it all of the strange fire and strange messages that the devil broadcasts 24/7, the gospel of Jesus Christ calls out to fallen man with a message of grace and full assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Christ came into the world to die for sinners, and it is Him Who is seeking those who are lost. Are you tossed to and fro, my friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You no longer need to be captured by worldly philosophyyou no longer need to be kidnapped by religion or unscientific theories. You can be set free and complete in Christ right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When you receive the truth about the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart, and you commit your life to Him and yield to His working in you and through you and around you, you will experience a tremendous sense of comfort, confidence and assurance.&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;A Fresh Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pastor Ben Hiwale&lt;/b&gt;

In our lives there are defining moments determining what path we will take. The moment we see the truth brought to light, we run for it, realizing that all we have ever known falls short in comparison. For the world, that moment was when Jesus died on the cross. His death at Calvary closed the chapter on mankinds separation from God, making a way for all to know Himand know Him intimately. As the perfect sacrifice for the entire world (&lt;b&gt;John 1:29b&lt;/b&gt;), Jesus completelypaid the debt (&lt;b&gt;John 19:30&lt;/b&gt;) necessary for us to come into relationshipwith our heavenly Father.

Jesus death on the cross changed the way we live and interact with Him today because God judged sin at Calvary. With the worlds sin on Jesus shoulders, God showed us how much He abhors sin, letting His Son die. Through Christs death, the barrier between God and ushas been removed (&lt;b&gt;Colossians 1:21-22&lt;/b&gt;), and God gives us a new startthrough forgiveness. That is how He dealt with Israel of old. Israelsuffered for her sin and folly, and went into captivity as a result of hersins. But through Isaiah God spoke a word of comfort to her centered in His word of forgiveness. Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem and cry to her ... that her iniquity is pardoned  (&lt;b&gt;Isaiah 40:1,2&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;!--more--&gt;

As a nation, Israel could make a fresh start only with Gods forgiveness,and God speaks this same word of forgiveness to us. To each one of us, He says: Your iniquity is pardoned. His word of comfort to us is in Jesus Christ.

Our sin goes a lot deeper than failure to follow a series of dos and donts. Sin is being altogether in the wrong, altogether heading in the wrong direction away from God, altogether cut off from the Lord God. The forgiveness of sin offers reconciliation for this situation. God opens up the way to us and puts us back on the right track. He makes possible a complete about-turn on our part, so that we can head God-ward, travel in fellowship with Him, and go in the direction He wants us to go. Jesus died to put you right with God and to put you back on the right track. He died so that you could escape the path of death you were walking, and enter with Him on the path of life. His forgiveness makes possible the good news of a fresh start.

The emptiness that we feel challenges something that we assume about ourselves.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unwanted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unworthy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
As we unpack this Passage we see 4 things:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Relationship - verse 11&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Transformation - verses 12-13&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Forgiveness - verses 13-14&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Victory - verse 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
So significant was this rite that when Moses neglected to circumcise his child, God threatened to kill Moses!

We must realize that there is nothing more, nothing less and nothing else than Jesus.

The point of circumcision was always intended to point to Gods power in circumcising our hearts.

Romans 2:29

&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;But a Jew is one &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;inwardly, and &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;His praise is not from man but from God.

Jeremiah 4:4

&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Circumcise yourselves to the Lord;

remove the foreskin of your hearts,

O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;f&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;lest my wrath go forth like fire,

and burn with none to quench it,

&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;because of the evil of your deeds

&lt;b&gt;Jeremiah 9:25&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, that I will punish all &lt;i&gt;who are&lt;/i&gt; circumcised with the uncircumcised

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;b&gt;Romans 4:9-12&lt;/b&gt;

New King James Version (NKJV)

&lt;b&gt;Abraham Justified Before Circumcision&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does&lt;/i&gt; this blessedness then &lt;i&gt;come&lt;/i&gt; upon the circumcised &lt;i&gt;only,&lt;/i&gt; or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness. &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;How then was it accounted? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised. &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;And he received the sign of circumcision, &lt;b&gt;a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, &lt;/b&gt;that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;and the father of circumcision to those who not only &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham &lt;i&gt;had while still&lt;/i&gt; uncircumcised.

Deuteronomy 10:16

&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Circumcise therefore &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;stubborn

Deuteronomy 30:6

&lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;And &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.&lt;b&gt;Ezekiel 36:26&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Three Matters: The Gospel Is NOT
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A message of moral effort - but radical regeneration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A message of what we justly deserve - but Jesus went to the Cross&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A message of Social Humanism - but total Victory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
How should we respond to all this? Let me suggest five responses to these truths:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Humility&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Confidence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Holiness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Surrender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
No matter where you are, know this:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are not &lt;i&gt;unwanted&lt;/i&gt;. We are &lt;i&gt;chosen&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Were not &lt;i&gt;unworthy&lt;/i&gt;were &lt;i&gt;redeemed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Were not &lt;i&gt;unable &lt;/i&gt; were &lt;i&gt;empowered&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Today you know:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Relationship  no longer caught in Religion Complete Transformation - no longer the Same&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Forgiveness  no longer in Debt&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete Victory  no longer Defeated&lt;/li&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>In these verses John is laying all important biblical and theological foundation of the deity of Christ that will be the basis of the rest of his letter. John does not come out of his corner jabbing with the heretics of his day. He comes with a Christ-centered, Scripture-based, Spirit-filled knockout punch. Beloved, we engage the enemy with the truth of God in hand, the love of God in our hearts and the glory of God our aim. Doctrine is important beloved, and sound doctrine is not only to be preserved, but proclaimed.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs 1,2- The Incarnation of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs 3-5;2.1,2- The purpose of John writing this epistle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs 6,7- The warning of profession of faith and saving faith.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs.8-10- The universal problem of sin.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Vs. 2.1,2- The proclamation of the gospel and extent of the atonement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
John, the human author of this epistle, was the last living apostle; and the only one who wasn't martyred for Christ. John also wrote the gospel of John, the Revelation and 1-3 John.
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is generally believed that these books were after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD, between the years of 80-95 AD.&lt;/p&gt;
He is writing from Ephesus, and he is writing to deal with a real problem that was presented by real people who were seducing the people of God with unbiblical doctrines that are in existence today.
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1 John 2.18, 19, these men are referred to as antichrist. In 2.26 they are referred to as seducers. In 4.1 they are called false teachers. None of these men would say that they were any of these things. Far from being against Jesus, these men would consider themselves to be teachers of the deep things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is commonly held that the heresy that John is speaking about and speaking against is Gnosticism. Basically, Gnosticism taught that spirit is good and matter is evil. The Gnostics didn't believe that God created the "evil" material world, but that a distant emanation of Him did. They believed that Jesus was a phantom when He lived on the Earth and didn't have a body of flesh. Therefore, they could not accept the Incarnation.That Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man. The fullness of the Godhead in bodily form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The heresy of Gnosticism with its intellectual and philosophical content was gaining a foothold in the Church when John wrote this letter. A man named Arias in the early 300s further developed Gnosticism. by denying the deity of Christ and claiming that The Father existed before Him, and that Jesus, though divine, was only a created being. The Arian heresy is the basis of the Watchtower Society's (Jehovah's Witnesses) belief system. This is the same root of modern Latter Day Saints (Mormon) doctrine, which holds that Jesus is the spirit brother of Lucifer, a created being. John sought to correct the heresy by emphasizing the deity of Jesus Christ in his writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1.1-4 John is laying all important biblical and theological foundation of the deity of Christ that will be the basis of the rest of his letter. John does not come out of his corner jabbing with these heretics. He comes with a Christ-centered, Scripture-based, Spirit-filled knockout punch. Beloved, we engage the enemy with the truth of God in hand, the love of God in our hearts and the glory of God our aim. Doctrine is important beloved, and sound doctrine is not only to be preserved, but proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Incarnation of Jesus Christ (Vs. 1,2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
"That Which Was From the Beginning" -Referring to the Deity and preexistence of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is not a created being. He is not an emanation from God or one of many avatars. Jesus Christ is The Creator of all things. This opening verse mirrors the opening line in the Gospel of John 1:1, again pointing to Jesus Christ.

The focus of these 2 verses is the Incarnation and deity of Jesus Christ. Jesus was already present from the beginning. He always was (John 1:1-2). He is the eternal I AM (John 8:58). Jesus is called in scripture the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end (Rev. 1:8, 17-18).

"We Have Heard...Seen...Handled" - John is refuting the Gnostic heresy of his day that taught that Jesus did not have a physical body. The Gnostics believed that all physical matter was evil. Therefore, Jesus could not have had a physical body. But John emphasizes his experience of Jesus with three of the five senses.

Jesus was not a phantom or a ghost. He was the Word made flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14). And there is a plurality of witnesses who have experienced the historical Christ with their senses.

"Word of life "- John chose to use a word here that would mean a great deal to both the Jew and the Greek of his day. Word here is Logos (Gk.) and had very deep meaning to the philosophers of John's time. Logos in philosophical thinking was the concept of the supreme thought and reason revealing divine mind. To the Jew it would refer to the divine Word of God, which was held in highest esteem to every devout Jew.

"Life" - There are several Greek words for life. The Greek word John chose to use for life here is also significant. &lt;em&gt;Zoe&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) means the absolute fullness of life. Because Jesus is God's Word to us made flesh, He is the Word that imparts Life to us (John 5:26).
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;v. 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"The life was Manifested" - &lt;em&gt;phaneroo&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.), meaning to make visible or known what has been hidden or unknown, whether by words, or deeds, or in any other way. Another error of Gnostic thought is that they were a select group to whom was given secret knowledge that was only revealed to a select few. John refutes this false doctrine of secrecy by declaring that with the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, God is not keeping any secrets from us.&lt;/p&gt;
That Jesus was manifested in the flesh is Johns testimony, not hearsay. (publicly seen and known) stresses the revelatory nature of Christs coming: he was sent from and revealed by God.

"That eternal life which was with The Father and was manifested unto us" - John is stating and 1 John 5.20 that Jesus the true God and eternal life. Jesus is The personal manifestation of eternal life to all that believe on His Name (John 17:3, 1 John 5:11-12).
&lt;h3&gt;The purpose for John writing this letter (Vs. 3-5;2.1,2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
"That you may have fellowship with us" - &lt;em&gt;koinonia&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.), meaning association, community, communion, joint participation.

John reveals that his reason for making this declaration to us was in order that we, by grace through faith may have fellowship with The Father and His Son Jesus as well as with other saints.
A vital part of the gospel message is that through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ, you and I step into the very same kind of relationship with The Father and Jesus that John and the first saints had had 2,000 years ago!

"With the Father and His Son Jesus Christ"  In the Trinity, God the Father is distinct from God the Son. Yet we cannot have fellowship with one without the other. You can't have fellowship with the Father apart from fellowship with the Son (1 John 2:23, 5:12, 20; 1 Cor. 1:9).

Our fellowship. The gospel message not only reconciles the sinner with The Father and Son, but it also binds together those who receive it.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"That Your Joy May be Full"  joy-&lt;em&gt;chara&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.), gladness and rejoicing and full-&lt;em&gt;pleroo&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) to fill to the top so that nothing shall be lacking, to liberally fill to the brim. Glorious! The Bible was not written to put us under a burden of obligation and fear. The message of the gospel is a source of joy and life to those who embrace its teachings (Ps. 144:15; John 15:11, 16:24; 2 Cor. 1:24).&lt;/p&gt;
Precious family, once again I feel compelled to point out to you the difference between happiness and joy. Happiness is a variable, which is subject to the unpredictable chances and changes of life. Jesus died in order that we might have His joy in the depth of our souls independent of the chances and changes of life. Joy in the Lord is a constant, because it is not based on our feelings or circumstances; it is based on the relationship we have with Him as His children.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Message" - &lt;em&gt;epaggelia&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) which We Have Heard from Him and Declare - &lt;em&gt;anaggello&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) to announce, make known, to report, bring back tidings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;John wants us to understand that the message he is declaring did not originate from his own imagination. It critical that when we read the scriptures we realize that the message conveyed is from God. John's message is in harmony with all the other New Testament writers who have also heard from God and have conveyed that message to us (1 Thess. 2:13).&lt;/p&gt;
"God is Light" - &lt;em&gt;phos&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) brightness, anything-emitting light. This word is allegorically used here to represent truth, knowledge, and spiritual purity (Ps. 27:1, 18:28, 36:9, 119:105). Spiritually speaking, God is light. According to Holy Scripture, Jesus is also described as Light (John 1:4-9, 8:12). This again supports the doctrine of the deity of Christ.

"Darkness" - &lt;em&gt;skotia&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) the absence of light. Used metaphorically here to refer to sin or evil of any kind. This word in context is describing that God is perfectly pure with no mixture, compromise, or pollution of any kind. God is sinless and perfect in every way. He is not responsible for my sin or your sin. He is not the cause of sin in any way shape or form.
&lt;h3&gt;The warning of profession of faith and genuine saving faith (vs. 6,7)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fellowship - Fellowship is intimate communication and communion. This chapter will clarify what it means to truly fellowship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
"Walk in Darkness" - Walk refers to the manner in which we are living. To walk in darkness means to live apart from the light of God's truth. This would naturally include the practice of sin.
In this day of easy just accept Christ and easy believism, there are many people who profess to be Christian and walk in fellowship with God because they go to church on Sunday, but in reality, they have never experienced a real change of heart and change of lifestyle through faith in Jesus Christ. Their faith is nothing more than a profession.

A person who is a false professor of faith is a person who does not the truth. The Greek here means that they do not make it their aim to walk according to Gods truth. They follow their own fleshly lusts and pleasures while maintaining a form of godliness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Walk in the Light as He is in the light" - Genuine repentance and saving faith is an ongoing change of heart, a change of mind, a change of desires and change of direction in life.it is really being born from above!&lt;/p&gt;
To walk in the light means to purpose to live in accordance and harmony with God's truths revealed in God's word. This means that we align our lives with Gods Word. Walking on the light means that what God calls sin, I will now call sin. Walking in the light means that What God hates, I will choose to hate. Walking in the light means that what God loves, I will choose to love.

And what is the outcome of that intentional decision to follow hard after God like the deer pants after the water brooks? We will have Fellowship With One Another  The overflow of walking in the light is fellowship on 2 levels, the vertical and horizontal levels. For a person to say that they have great fellowship with God but have no desire for fellowship with other Christians is contrary to Scripture. All those who walk with Jesus will intentionally and deliberately seek to walk in fellowship with other believers.

Beloved if you are serious about following Jesus Christ, and if you claim to love God, it is vital that you seek to cultivate friendship and fellowship with people who will challenge you to live holy and be holy.

But Christians are not perfect; we still sin and fall short of the glory of God. What is it that washes away our sin? Blood of Jesus Christ...Cleanses - Notice that this cleansing is a continual process present tense: cleanses. As long as we are in this body of flesh we will always need the blood of Jesus for continual cleansing of sin. We are in continual need of the cleansing that comes from the blood of Jesus Christ. It is only through the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the cross that we find forgiveness and cleansing of sin (Lev. 17:11, Heb. 10:19).
How much sin does the blood of Jesus wash away? All Sin - There is no sin that the blood of Jesus cannot wash away when we are walking in the light.
&lt;h3&gt;The universal problem of sin (vs. 8-10)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"If We Say that We Have No Sin, We Deceive Ourselves"  To say that we have no sin is a denial of having a sin nature. To live in denial our sin nature reveals that the truth of God (and thus God one remedy for sin) is not in us. Each and every one of us was born with a sin nature. We are born sinners by nature and by choice.&lt;/p&gt;
The consequence of having this sin nature is that we are by nature and choice, enemies of God. Rebels against His authority and rule. Liable for punishment and deserving of His wrath, with no hope of changing that just punishment with our own efforts.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"If we Confess" - Confess in the Greek simply means to say the same as or to agree with God and acknowledge that He is right and we are wrong. And what is the promise from God when we confess our sin?&lt;/p&gt;
"God is Faithful" - &lt;em&gt;pistos&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) trustworthy, reliable and true and Just - &lt;em&gt;dikaios&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) righteous, faultless, innocent and guiltless. To do what?

"Forgive" - &lt;em&gt;aphiemi&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) to let go, give up a debt, to remit our Sins - &lt;em&gt;hamartia&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) an offense committed against God. To miss or wander from the path of uprightness and honor, to do or go wrong.

"Cleanse" - &lt;em&gt;katharizo&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) In a moral sense, to free from defilement of sin and from faults. To free from guilt of sin, to purify.

"Unrighteousness" - &lt;em&gt;adikia&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) Injustice of heart and life. A description of all moral wrong.

Another important fact to consider beloved is this. If we refuse to confess when we have sinned, we are proudly resisting God's truth. If we refuse to confess a sin, we are likewise refusing to forsake that sin. Our hearts will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, and our fellowship with Jesus and others will suffer.

Beloved, we cannot be friends of God and friends with the world (2.15-17; James 4.4). We cannot walk after the flesh and after the Spirit simultaneously (Gal 5.16-26). We cannot walk in sensuality and be working out our own salvation with fear and trembling at the same time. Thus Peter's exhortation to make your calling and election sure.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"If We Say that We Have Not Sinned...His Word is Not in Us" - If we say we have not sinned or no longer sin now that we are in Christ, we are disagreeing with God and calling Him a liar. His word tells us that we are sinners, and to deny our sinful rot and the fact that we are sinners by choice is to call God a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So where do we turn? How do we atone for the debt and penalty of sin? How are we set free from the bondage and defilement of sin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The proclamation of the gospel and the extent of the atonement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;v. 2:1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Little Children" - &lt;em&gt;teknion&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) In the NT, used as a term of kindly address by teachers to their disciples. John, now very aged as he writes this book, addresses his readers as his dear children. This accurately reflects the heart of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
"Sin" - &lt;em&gt;hamartano&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) to miss the mark, do wrong, offend or trespass. "That You May Not Sin" - John continues to accurately represent the heart of God to us here. It is God's desire that we do not practice sin (1 John 3:4-5). Too often people use the fact that God can forgive sins as an excuse to continue in sin. This attitude is contrary to God's plan for those in Christ (Rom 6.1). The scriptures have been written to set us free from both the consequences of sin and the practice of sin. Gods patience with us when we sin should never be interpreted as permission from God to sin.

"If Anyone Sins" - God's perfect plan for us is that we don't sin. Yet, we are imperfect beings. So here, John is admitting that there is the likelihood of a Christian sinning. The writers of scripture never excuse our sin. But God makes provision for the cleansing of our sins in Christ. If we sin, God has a solution in the next phrase.

"An Advocate With the Father "- Advocate is a legal term referring to someone who comes alongside to support us and plead our case before the judge. When we sin, we stand guilty before God the Father. Jesus is, in fact, the One who argues the case in our defense before God the Father. It is important here to understand the power behind Jesus' argument. He does not argue for our innocence, for we are surely guilty. But the power of Jesus' argument before the Father is that the penalty of our sin has already been paid for with His blood, at the cross (Is. 53:4-6, 10; Gal. 3:13; Eph. 5:2; 1 Peter 3:18).

Jesus Christ intercedes with God for us when we sin. Jesus acts as our attorney and defends us (&lt;a href="https://www.blb.org/Bible.cfm?b=Hbr&amp;amp;c=7#25"&gt;Hebrews 7:25&lt;/a&gt;) when Satan brings accusations against us (&lt;a href="https://www.blb.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rev&amp;amp;c=12#10"&gt;Revelation 12: 10&lt;/a&gt;). When Satan accuses us, we tend to draw away from God because of a sense of shame and unworthiness. When the Holy Spirit convicts us, we're drawn to God to make things right with Him.
Also notice that John doesn't give us a number of advocates to chose from. Jesus is the only one who can mediate for us before God (1 Tim. 2:5).

"Righteous" - This is the reason that Jesus can stand before God as our advocate. He is the righteous &lt;em&gt;dikaios&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.), meaning innocent, faultless, guiltless, pleasing before God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v. 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Propitiation" - &lt;em&gt;hilasmos&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) the appeasing and appropriate payment, atonement. Jesus is the one who appeased and satisfied the anger and wrath of God toward our sins when He took the punishment for our sins upon Himself. His death on the cross was satisfactory payment (propitiation) for our sins in God's eyes (4:10).&lt;/p&gt;
"Also for the Whole World" - Jesus is the propitiation for all the sins of all the people in the entire world. This doesn't mean that everyone is automatically saved. What is does mean is that there is provision for the forgiveness of sin for anyone and everyone who will come to God on the basis of Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice.

As the elements are being passed out, let me state that all that Christ has done for us means absolutely nothing unless I am in Him by faith. Receive Him this morning as Lord. All the work of atonement is done. Jesus said, This is the work of God, that you believe in Him Whom He has sent (John 6.29).
&lt;h3&gt;Ending comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you asked Christ to be Lord of your life, it is important that you confess Him before men. Call us at (585) 385-0450. We would love to pray with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beware of the subtle seductions and additions to the faith that was once delivered to the saints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stand solid against the spirit of antichrist that is the spirit of the age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Like John in verses 1.1-4, be bold in your affirmation of Who Jesus is. Do not confuse dialogue with the enemy as being the same as the declaration of Gods truth. Courage does not require us to be militant or mean spirited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Time is short beloved, time is not on your side. Make your life count for Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These passages of Scripture were not only vital for the preservation of the gospel of the grace of God in Pauls day; they are vital for the church in 2013. For the heretical teachings that were posing a threat to the saints at Colossae and Laodicea exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As we saw in my &lt;a href="/lords-supper-1-john-1-2-1/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; in 1 John, there were false teachers who were saying that your belief in Jesus is fine, but faith alone in Jesus is not enough. These false teachers were not only well versed and deeply committed to their beliefs; they were also intellectually and philosophically persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With apostolic authority, The Holy Spirit, through Paul exposes the 3 seductive messages that sought to undermine the message of the gospel of the grace of God and the completeness that we have in Christ Jesus by grace through faith in Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legalism.&lt;/strong&gt; Religious legalism that was based on Old Testament ordinances which were only shadows of what Jesus Christ would fulfill (vs.16, 17). The answer to legalism is the spiritual reality we have in Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mysticism &lt;/strong&gt;and esoteric spiritual experiences (vs. 18) instead of a genuine abiding relationship with The Head of the body, Jesus Christ. The answer to mysticism is the spiritual union with Christ, the Head of the church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asceticism.&lt;/strong&gt; Self imposed, man-made asceticism (extreme abstinence from pleasure)that is of no value to atone for sin or curb the flesh (vs. 20-23). The answer to asceticism is the fullness that we have in Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, when Jesus said it is finished, He wasnt kidding. He accomplished the entire work of atonement, and the validation of that His perfect sacrifice was accepted by The Father was His bodily resurrection from the dead.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Legalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 16. Let no man therefore judge you in meat (food) or I drink or in respect of a holyday, or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days. 17. Which area shadow of the things to come (they have only symbolic value), but the body (the substance) is of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It would appear that the legalists that Paul talked about were the Judaizers. This group of men and their message of faith in Christ + circumcision and keeping the law of Moses is seen through the NT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and drink.&lt;/strong&gt; The false teachers sought to impose some sort of dietary regulations, probably based on those of the Mosaic law (cf. Lev. 11). Since they were under the New Covenant, the Colossians (like all Christians) were not obligated to observe the OT dietary restrictions (cf. Mark 7: 1419; Acts 10: 915; Rom. 14: 17; 1 Cor. 8: 8; 1 Tim. 4: 15; Heb. 9: 910).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy days.&lt;/strong&gt; The annual religious celebrations of the Jewish calendar (e. g., Passover, Pentecost, or Tabernacles (Booths); cf. Lev. 23).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New moon&lt;/strong&gt;. The monthly sacrifice offered on the first day of each month (Num. 10: 10 28: 1114; Ps. 81: 3).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabbath.&lt;/strong&gt; The weekly celebration of the seventh day, which pictured Gods rest from creation. The NT clearly teaches that Christians are not required to keep it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Judaizers message was at best, making the observance of these things a sign of spirituality. At worst, they insisted that in addition to faith in Jesus Christ, the keeping of these things was necessary for their salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved whenever a person's salvation or spirituality is measured by your diet or the calendar, the emphasis is not longer Christ, but something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, all of these things mentioned in verse 16 had its proper function for the Jewish people under the old covenant. But it was not meant to be a permanent part of the faith under the new covenant (see John 1:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Law was a schoolmaster that helped to train and discipline Israel in the childhood of the nation, preparing the people for the coming of the Messiah. The Law was given to reveal sin and warn us of the consequences of sinbut it has no power to prevent sin or redeem the sinner. Only the power contained in the gospel of the grace of God can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now that Jesus had come, the schoolmaster was no longer needed (Gal. 3:244:11).The ceremonial aspects of the OT law (dietary regulations, festivals, sacrifices) were mere shadows pointing to Christ. Since Christ, the reality has come; the shadows have no value. Cf. Heb. 8: 5 10:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Jewish or Gentile believer who judges a another believer because that believer is not living under Jewish laws and regulations is really judging Jesus Christ. He is saying that Christ did not finish the work of salvation on the cross, and that we must add something to it. He is also saying that Jesus Christ is not sufficient for all the spiritual needs of the Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No longer under the law? Listen carefully beloved; it is OT sacrificial types of the various sin offerings, priesthood and the ceremonial law of God that has been fulfilled by Jesus Christ. Gods moral laws transcend time and culture and are in still in tact today and Christians are still obligated to honor the moral law of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Here is legalism in a nutshell: Christ + rituals (any ritual) = Salvation. Christ plus any ritual is not the gospel. The Lords Supper proves that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mysticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels (insist that you abase yourself and worship angelic beings), intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 19 And not holding (they have lost connection with) the Head, from which (from Whom) all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God (grows as God causes it to grow).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mysticism, in this context, means the alleged experience of the worship of angelic beings. In the Scriptures, whenever God in His providence allowed anybody to have an encounter with an angel, (unless it was a preincarnate appearance of Jesus Christ under the title Angel of The Lord) the angel was rebuked for worshipping him (as was the case of the apostle John in the book of Revelation 21.8,9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Others were claiming that the only way that mortal man could come into contact with a holy God was through an angelic mediator. Beloved, any claim to having an encounter with God the Father through anyone or anything other than His Son, Jesus Christ, is demonic and idolatry. Jesus Christ is the one and only Mediator between God and man (John 14:6; 1 Tim. 2:5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mysticism and the seeking of spiritual experiences outside of and beyond the scope of the Word of God is dangerous because by doing so, a person is opening themselves to all kinds of counterfeit experiences and demonic activity, masquerading themselves as angels of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Deut 18.10 there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, 11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yes, here are valid biblical experiences that a born again Christian may have in their walk with Jesus Christ. But here was the problem, these false teachers doctrines were not making Christ preeminent and all sufficient, thus whenever a person or a church loses connection with The Head, Jesus Christ, inevitably, an experience of some kind will become the focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Saints, the ultimate Christian experience is intimacy with The Lord Jesus Christ in prayer, in His Word, in fellowship with other believers, in worship. The normal Christian life is a supernaturally natural one in the midst of your daily routine in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There is no spiritual growth for the body (the church) apart from union with the head, Christ (cf. John 15: Eph. 4: 1516). Beloved, the source of life and purity and growth is not the result keeping of a religious diet, the keeping of holy days or spiritual experiences, but as verse 19 says, through "holding fast to the head (Christ) from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The only hope for personal spiritual growth and congregational health in the body of Christ at Koinonia Fellowship will be the overflow of a deliberate and diligent cleaving to Jesus Christ the head, not experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Here is mysticism in a nutshell: Christ + experience = Salvation. Christ plus any experience is not the gospel. Knowing Jesus Christ IS the experience of the gospel (Jer 9.23,24; John 17.3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Asceticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world (as though you still belong to the world), are ye subject to ordinances, 21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not; 22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after (are based upon) the commandments and doctrines of men? 23 Which things have indeed a show (an outward appearance) of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Verses 21-23 point out the futility of asceticism, which basically is the attempt to achieve holiness by rigorous self- neglect (v. 23), self- denial (v. 21), and even self-infliction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There is a definite relationship between legalism and asceticism, for the ascetic often subjects himself to rules and regulations.The ascetics entire life is wrapped up in a self-imposed system of rules by which he or she measures another persons spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Paul disciplined his own body and kept it under control (1 Cor. 9:27). So there is a place in our Christian lives for proper care of our bodies and keeping our bodily appetites under control and subject to the will of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the ascetics hope to either save himself or sanctify his or her soul by the keeping of self-imposed rules and regulations is that which is being refuted by Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Here is asceticism in a nutshell: Christ + self-imposed rules and regulations according to the commandments of men = salvation. Christ plus man made commandments or works is not the gospel. We are saved by grace through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast. Eph 2.8,9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These men rejected biblical, apostolic authority and were proud, self-righteous and condemning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These teachers who were identified by Jude as "clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever." (Jude 12,13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Paul identified them as false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light (2 Cor 12.13,14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) The gospel of the grace of God humbles us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Remember this beloved, a genuine encounter with Jesus Christ will humble a person. Grace humbles you; it does not puff you up.Yes, the grace of God will embolden you to stand for the truth in the face of lies and deception, but it will never cause you to be arrogant, haughty or self-righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A true encounter with The Living God will always strip a person of spiritual pride. A true encounter with Jesus Christ will cause your mind to be awed by the greatness of God; your heart will be filled with a love for God; your soul is gripped by the majesty and wonder of God; and as a result, your will is going to be submitted to the purpose that God has for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Job met the Lord he said, I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes (Job 42:56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Peter fell down before his Lord and said, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord (Luke 5:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Isaiah said Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts (Isa 6.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When John saw the risen Christ, he fell at His feet like a dead man (Rev. 1:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) What about Christian liberty on matters of eating and drinking etc..?, Christian Liberty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The consumption of food and drink is in itself no basis for judging another person's salvation or standing in the body of Christ. To be sure Paul had to deal with the abuse of food and drink; namely, the problem of eating meat offered to idols and the problem of drunkenness (1 Corinthians 8, 11: 21; Romans 14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Romans 14.15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Corinthians 8. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. 10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When we are considering doing something that we know is all right for us, we must ask ourselves two questions. 1.) Will this action cause peace or division in the church? Will this promote harmony or will it cause a problem. 2.) Will my brother in Christ grow by seeing me do this, or will his growth in the Lord be stunted by my actions? We must be very careful that we do not allow our liberty to hinder the church as a whole, or the individual members in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The whole point of this verse is that there are times when we must limit our liberty so that we do not hinder a fellow believer in their walk with the Lord. There are things that I know would not be wrong for me to do. However, there are people watching my life. Therefore, I dont do those things, by choice, so that I dont offend that weaker brother or sister. If I hinder them and cause them to sin, I have not been Christlike, but I have been very selfish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I am asked what my take is on Christian liberty is: "It is my prayer and the prayer of my colleagues in church leadership that every person who calls Koinonia Fellowship their home church, for the sake of Christ and for the love of our unsaved neighbors and fellow Christians will abstain from any habits or life styles that fail to honor Christ and will seek to perfect holiness in the fear of God doing everything in word and deed to His honor and glory."&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Happy Fathers Day! Today, I am addressing all the men, and in particular husbands and fathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Psalm 128.Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It has been said that before the fall Paradise was man's home; since the fall home has been his Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you want to build a house, you need a blueprint that shows the design of the house and the necessary materials. If you want to build a holy, Christ centered, God glorifying home, there is only one blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Psalm 127.1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No one in their right mind would consider building a house for his or her family without having a blueprint. And yet while we wouldnt think of building a house without a blueprint, many people, even Christians, go about building their homes with no idea of Gods plan for marriage or childrearing or the kind of materials that are necessary to build one that will bring glory to His Holy Name.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Being A Real Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Husbands, fathers and every young men who one day will be married and have a family, I want to say right up front that a non negotiable foundation for building a godly marriage and raising godly children is being a man who is waking in the fear of God. Gods eye and blessing is upon the man that walks in the fear of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;My dear brothers in Christ, old or young, married or unmarried, decide today that the Word of God is going to define what real manhood is, not Mens Health Magazine, not ESPN, not GQbut Gods Word, and His Son Jesus Christ as our Example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a Christian home, the father and husband are called by God to be the spiritual rudder of the family, the spiritual compass for direction and the thermostat that regulates the spiritual atmosphere in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We see here in Psalm 128 that a fruitful wife and children are those who respond to the godly, loving leadership of a husband and father who fears The Lord and walks in His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The blessed or happy home is one that is led by a man that fears the Lord and walks in His ways. As Joshua said in Josh 24.15 as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the man that fears God, the one overruling command for himself and each and every member of his family is simple. As for me and my house, we will serve The Lord. Did you notice here Dad that serving God in your home is not an option it is a commandment? Listen to how God described Abraham, the man of faith:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gen 18.19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Deut 6.4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: 5 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Headship is the divine calling of a husband to take primary responsibility for Christ- like servant leadership, protection, and provision in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Men, we must stop making excuses for being passive and accept the call and challenge of God to lead by example and in love. Now when I say that word love, many people misinterpret that to mean either passive or weak. Beloved, Jesus as Son of Man was filled with the love of God and He is neither passive nor weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I declare to you this morning unashamedly, boldly and lovingly that Gods order for the home does not bow down to the spirit of the age or feminism. Eph 5 clearly tells us that the husband, the man is called to be the head of the home. Husband, father, despite all of our weaknesses, we need to own up to the fact that God has called us to be the spiritual head of our homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Men, as much as we might not like to hear it, we cannot escape the fact that we are examples to our children, either for good or for bad. Granted, no man is perfect, but fathers, is your lifestyle one that points your wife and children to Christ, or away from Him? It is so important that we live out our Christianity in our attitudes, words, and actions in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dads, your children need you to fear God. Theyre facing humanism that tells them man is the center of everything. Materialism tells them happiness belongs in things. Hedonism tells them to live high, wide and handsome. Relativism tells them there are no absolutes, no fixed standards of right and wrong. They need a God-fearing dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Men, a great deal of what our children learn about family life and life in general comes from watching our example. Your children hear how you talk to their mother. They see the things that you watch on television. They see how much free time and money you invest in hobbies. They know who your friends are. They see the books and magazines on the coffee table. Scary, isnt it! None of us have the luxury to say, I am not into that example thing, dude. Yes, you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Oh Happy Man!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let me ask every single man a question. Who wants to be a blessed man? Even if up to this point in time in your life, you have not followed The Lord or the teachings of The Bible, how many of you would say, Pastor Ray, I want to be a blessed man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Psalm 119.59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Look at Psalm 128.1,4. The word blessed can also be translated "happy". Connect the dots of Scripture men; the blessed man, the happy man, is the man that fears The Lord and walks in His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What is the fear of the Lord? I define it as a healthy respect and reverence for God stemming from the knowledge of God and resulting in obedience to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thus, the fear of God is the cornerstone of all blessedness men. The blessed man is not the man that sings that once popular Frank Sinatra song, I did it my way., the blessed man is the man that submits to Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This fear of the Lord is the first fountain of holy living and marital and family life, for it is the fear of The Lord that cultivates an atmosphere of respect and reverence for The Lord that results in loving submission and obedience to The Lord. And this reverence, submission and obedience to The Lord are rooted in grace, humility and love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fear of The Lord is unlike common fears that we have. For example, I should not think that fearing heights, or fearing snakes is the same as fearing God, for they are not in the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fearing heights or fearing snakes is not a moral issue. It has nothing to do with my heart, character or who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fear of The Lord comes from knowing Him, and you cannot have the fear of The Lord if you are not born again. The fear of the Lord stems from that mighty work of Gods Spirit and Gods Word in my heart that opens my soul up to an understanding of His greatness, power, and absolute holiness that never existed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As we have seen many times in studying the Word of God together, every time a man, even a righteous man, gets a glimpse of God in the splendor of His holiness, he is stricken with both humility and fear. A man who is proud, arrogant and a dictator may or may not be a man that controls his wife and his children, but I can tell you one thing for sure. That man is not a man that loves Jesus Christ and fears The Living God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In terms of home life, a man who fears God will not use Gods Name lightly or name in vain. He will not joke about God or be flippant toward God or His Word. He will seek to cultivate an atmosphere of holiness and wholesomeness for the glory of God. He will take the initiative in leading his family in reading Gods Word, in prayer, and in a commitment to living a life both in the secular world and in the church for the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Men, it is nothing but hot air to tell your children to walk after the things of God if you or I refuse to fear God and choose to walk after the flesh, or do things my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;if the heart is joined unto God, the feet will follow hard after him. A man's heart will be seen in his walk, and the blessing will come where heart and walk are both with God. Charles Spurgeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Verse 2. Thou shalt eat of the fruit of thy labors. Happy (blessed) shalt thou be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although the context here is speaking of enjoying the fruit of fearing God, let me say this morning that God is the God of laborers, and Christian men are to be examples of hard work. God has not called the husband/father to eat the bread of idleness, but to provide for his family according to the will and blessing of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1 Timothy 5.8 But if any provides not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though we are in God's hands, God will give us the means to earn our daily bread by own by labor. This means that the man that fears God is a man that recognizes the providence of God in the realm of his vocation. Thus, he is thankful for the work that he has and the God given ability to do that work as unto The Lord Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The man who fears God isnt grumbling about how hard he has to work to provide for his family. He may indeed be physically or emotionally tired in his work, but for the most part, he is a cheerful, pleasant man to live with. Why? The key to his happiness is given twice, so we wont miss it: He fears the Lord and walks in His ways (vv. 1, 4). This mans happiness doesnt come from circumstances; his joy is in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Brothers, providing for your family means much more than putting bread on the table. It includes the provision of all the elements of a Christ-like home: teaching and modeling Gods Word in an atmosphere of love, grace, patience, loving discipline, understanding, and encouragement. This would also include modeling biblical values, priorities, and pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A man who pursues only financial success to the disregard of his home will end up a lonely man with poverty in his soul. A man who seeks first the kingdom of God and follows Gods blueprint for the home will end up a blessed man with prosperity in his soul.&lt;/p&gt;
Happy shalt thou be. John Wesley said, the man that fears God and joyously obeys God would be happy in Him. 

The Lord Jesus is a deep sea of joy: Let your soul shall dive in and shall be swallowed up in the delights of His company. Alistair Begg
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A God fearing happy dad is most likely to have a God fearing happy wife and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;God promises that it shall be well with you.&lt;/p&gt;
"It shall be well with thee while thou livest. It shall be better with thee when thou diest. It shall be best of all with thee in eternity." Matthew Henry
&lt;h3&gt;Your Wife&lt;/h3&gt;
A helpmeet was needed in Paradise, and most assuredly, a helpmeet is needed in todays fallen world. Please note ladies and wives that The Word of God speaks of you as a helpmeet. You are not your husbands mother. He that findeth a wife findeth a good thing.
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Good wives (godly, Spirit filled) are gifts from God and expressions of His kindness and goodness to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A fruitful vine in that hot Middle Eastern climate is one that produces something refreshing and nourishing for others. A godly wife and mother will not be a lazy, self-centered, aimless woman if she is married to a godly, God-fearing husband because. As a rule of thumb, a Christ loving, Spirit filled, God-fearing husband will inspire a wife to be industrious and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A man that fears The Lord is a man who is blessed if he has a wife that fears The Lord and walks in His ways. That husband is a blessed man indeed. She is a fruitful vine, and a faithful housekeeper; her chief ministry and focus is the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Your Children&lt;/h3&gt;
Contrary to popular notions, children are not interruptions to the good life; they are blessings and gifts from God that we are to bring up in the nurture and admonition of The Lord.
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Children were designed by God to be the fruit of a godly union between a husband and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Children described as olive plants around the table. These olive plants are not mature trees, but little shoots that grow up around a mature olive tree. They will someday replace the parent tree, continuing to bear fruit after it is gone. Dad, one of your top priorities and primary responsibilities before God is to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of The Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I heard a shocking statement by an old pastor some time ago. He said that he was deeply concerned that the vast majority of Christian parents were making it their priority to raise their children to be good kids. They are teaching their children to do good in school, do not hang around with the wrong crowd, do not do drugs or drink, do not have sex outside of marriage, do not be lazy, work hard and so on and so forth. Now all of these things are good in and of themselves, but they fall far short of Gods ideal for parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are many young people today who are educated (and education is good), athletic (and being athletic and the discipline that goes along with it is good), hard working and saving money (and it is biblical to work hard and save money). But there are many educated, athletic, hard working young people today who are not being raised by their parents n the nurture and admonition of The Lord, and as a result are being conformed to the world, are hell bound and have no fear of God. Is that good??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some dads are not outgoing or not very good at communicating with their children. They may ask, how do I get a conversation going and what should we talk about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fathers, dads, a good place to begin is by going to the book of Proverbs and read every one of the hear my son conversations. They are loaded with the wisdom of God on who to hang around with, the kind of girl to avoid, how to be hard working, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To raise our children in the nurture and admonition of The Lord means that we should saturate every aspect of our daily life with God. He should be the source and goal of all our acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1 Corinthians 10: 31Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your Childrens Children&lt;/h3&gt;
Old age is only blessed when a mans life has been spent in the fear and service of God. The man pictured here is a happy old man, enjoying Gods blessing as he sees his grandchildren following the Lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Proverbs 17:6 states, "Childrens children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A dad and his son were climbing a mountain and came to a difficult part. The dad stopped to consider the best route up. Behind him, his son called out, Choose the best path, Dad! Im coming right behind you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ps 78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fathering is declaring the wondrous works of God in such a way that our children learn to live for something greater than the things of this world, money, or fame but for the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fathering is telling our children by precept and example to love God, to serve The Lord, to obey God and leave all of the consequences to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Men, old and young, married and single with or without childrenmy admonition to each and every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ is this. Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. Devote your life, your time, your God given talents and resources to something that will out live you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Fatherhood of God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ps 103:11 As heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy towards those who fear Him. 13 Like as a father pitieth (shows compassion to) his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1 Chronicles 29.10 Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever and ever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus told a multitude that followed Him that they were to address God as Our Father, Who art in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;God created fatherhood in His own image. Men, good fathering points to God. It points children to God, it points wives to God, it points coworkers to God, it points fellow church members to God, and it points relatives to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The main purpose of fathering is to reveal the fatherhood of God. The main purpose of being a husband is to reveal the love and kindness of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This Fathers Day  as you think of your earthly father or the father of your children  do you know the One, the Everlasting Father? The Only Perfect Father?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Do you know the One who died on the cross for your sin? Do you know the One, Who by grace through faith in Him, can call the God of the universe Abba, Father?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The title Father assumes a relationship. A relationship that is based totally on the grace and mercy of God through faith in His Son Jesus Christ. To know all of the facts about the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ apart from receiving Him as Lord in your life means absolutely nothing. For all of the benefits and blessings of God from forgiveness of sin and a new heart are only given to those who call upon His Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In one of the great mysteries of the Bible, God says to the dead, rise up. He says to the blind, see. He says to the deaf hear. God makes all things new.for those who have ears to hear, eyes to see, and a heart that is desiring a new life or a new start, look to Jesus and embrace Him as Lord.&lt;/p&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>Today is Mothers Day, and I want to acknowledge all you mothers, and want to say how much we &lt;i&gt;appreciate&lt;/i&gt; you and all that you do for your families.Not only do I want to acknowledge you and extend my appreciation for you, I now would like to &lt;i&gt;admonish&lt;/i&gt; all wives and mothers. But this message is for all women.old or young, married or single, with or without children.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesus and womanhood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
In the midst of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish cultures, which viewed women almost on the level of possessions, it was The Lord Jesus Christ who by His teaching and practical example showed The Fathers expression of love and dignity for women. The teachings of Gods Word and the gospel of Jesus Christ is what gives to women true dignity and purpose in life.

In light of the ongoing pressure from the liberal church and media to redefine gender, marriage and the role of women in the home, our study this morning is going to be looking to &lt;i&gt;the one and only guide for authority structure in the home&lt;/i&gt; and that is the Word of God. Please turn with me to &lt;b&gt;Titus 2.3-5.&lt;/b&gt;

By the way sisters, lest any of you feel like I am picking on you this morning, Lord willing, I plan on addressing the subject of husband hood and fatherhood on Fathers Day.

My desire is to open the Word of God in order to bless you, encourage you and admonish you to do The Lords will, The Lords way, for The Lords glory.&lt;!--more--&gt;

As you make your way to Titus 2, I want to read you a Scripture from Proverbs 14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

A wise married woman is a woman who fears God, and builds her life and her house upon the wisdom of Scripture. She is a woman who is deeply devoted to The Lord Jesus Christ and realizes that marriage is a covenant where very specific and broad vows like &lt;i&gt;for better or worse &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;in sickness and in health &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;for richer or poorer &lt;/i&gt;are made before God and her husband.

How does a woman/wife pluck down her house? Like Eve in the garden, she questions what God says and lives according to her feelings or the world system apart from God.

Beloved, we are living in a day and age when there are more marriages in the church are falling apart and more homes and lives are or have been destroyed because people (&lt;i&gt;both male and female&lt;/i&gt;) love themselves more than they fear God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Titus 2:1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Many times I will have the question asked of me, what is a Womans role in the home and in the church? I would answer that the womens role in the church largely coincides with her role in the home.

Keep in mind that verse 3-5 were part of the &lt;b&gt;sound doctrine&lt;/b&gt; that Titus was to &lt;b&gt;speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee (Titus 2.15).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The aged (&lt;i&gt;older&lt;/i&gt;) women likewise, that theybe in behavior as becometh holiness (&lt;i&gt;sacred, holy, reverent, consecrated to God&lt;/i&gt;), not false accusers (&lt;i&gt;slanderers, gossips&lt;/i&gt;), not given to (&lt;i&gt;addicted&lt;/i&gt;) much wine, teachers of good things (&lt;i&gt;beautiful; attractive&lt;/i&gt;); That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, (.&lt;i&gt;WHY?)&lt;/i&gt; that the word of God be not blasphemed (&lt;i&gt;dishonored, maligned&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
According to the Holy Spirit of God, please note that it was the older women, not Pastor Titus, that were to teach the younger women these 12 things. Yes, as a pastor/teacher, it is &lt;i&gt;my responsibility&lt;/i&gt; to pass along to you sisters these truths &lt;b&gt;with all authority&lt;/b&gt;, but it is &lt;i&gt;your responsibility&lt;/i&gt; to put them into practice.

My precious older sisters in Christ, may I encourage you to resist the fallen, fractured model of the world system and cultivate a hands on biblical model of these things in your in your home and in this church family.

The godly older women have the responsibility of teaching their daughters, granddaughters and younger women in the church how to be successful wives, mothers, and housekeepers; and the younger women have the responsibility of listening and obeying.

The topics comprising the teaching of the older women in verses 3 through 5 are &lt;i&gt;very practical and focused on the domestic sphere&lt;/i&gt;. The focus in these verses is that older women are to pass along their biblical and practical experiences to the younger women in order that they might learn to be godly wives and mothers.

If the older sisters and not teaching their daughters, granddaughters or younger sisters in the church, or, if the younger women arent learning from the older women, the next generation wont have any older women who have anything to teach. There will be no legacy to pass on.

And what is the ultimate purpose for this instruction? Once again, the ultimate purpose of being a godly wife and mother (1) &lt;b&gt;that the word of God be not blasphemed&lt;/b&gt; (verse 5) and (2) &lt;b&gt;that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you &lt;/b&gt;(verse 8).

Would you note that the primary purpose for obeying the word of God is that the Name of Jesus Christ be held in high esteem and honor. It brings discredit and reproach to the Name of Jesus when we &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; that we affirm the Scripture as final authority, but live our lives as if &lt;i&gt;we are the final authority and &lt;/i&gt;God or the Bible does not even exist.

Why is it urgent for older, God fearing, lovers of Christ sisters to teach younger women? Well first if all, because God says so...but here is another reason:

The Minneapolis Star-Tribune (October 23, p. A18) carried Mary McCartys review of Joan Brumbergs recent book, The Body Project. The book is about the difference between how girls saw themselves 100 years ago and how they see themselves today. Brumberg analyzes diaries of adolescent girls from the 1830s to the 1990s. Her conclusion, according to the reviewer: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, girls diaries focused on good works and perfecting the character. In the 1990s, the diaries are fixated on good looks, on perfecting the body.

For example, one diary from 1892 says, &lt;i&gt;Resolvedto think before speaking. To work seriously. To be self-restrained in conversations and actions. To be dignified. Interesting myself more in others&lt;/i&gt;. Contrast this with an entry from 1982: &lt;i&gt;I will try to make myself better in any way I possibly can with the help of my budget and babysitting money. I will lose weight, get new lenses, already got new haircut, good makeup, new clothes and accessories&lt;/i&gt;.

Okay, I realize that I am walking on a tight rope now, but some of you ladies may be asking yourself the question, and who is it that is an older woman? Paul (wisely&lt;b&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;) does not specify the age a woman would have to be to qualify as &lt;b&gt;older&lt;/b&gt;. But &lt;i&gt;childbearing typically&lt;/i&gt; ends at about 40 years of age and, correspondingly, &lt;i&gt;childrearing ends at about 60&lt;/i&gt;. It therefore seems reasonable to take older women as referring to women that are around the age of 60 years old.

These passages of Scripture, along with the many others found in the Bible reveal design for women. It is a design which will fulfill their created purpose, maximize their uniqueness, make them a blessing to the world and bring fulfillment to their own lives and glory to the name of God. And that design is briefly stated there in those verses 3-5.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The aged (&lt;i&gt;older&lt;/i&gt;) women likewise, that they (1) be in behavior as becometh holiness (&lt;i&gt;sacred, holy, reverent, consecrated to God&lt;/i&gt;), (2) not false accusers (&lt;i&gt;slanderers, gossips&lt;/i&gt;), (3) not given to (&lt;i&gt;addicted&lt;/i&gt;) much wine, (4) teachers of good things (&lt;i&gt;beautiful; attractive&lt;/i&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(1) Holiness&lt;/b&gt; A lifestyle that reflects holiness and reverence; devotion and consecration to God in conduct, speech and dress. &lt;b&gt;Behavior&lt;/b&gt; points to their demeanor or inner character. The reverent woman fears God and lives in His presence.

&lt;b&gt;(2) Not false accusers- &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;to defame; to inform against; to bring charges with hostile intent&lt;/i&gt;. This is a single word in the Greek that is used 34 times to describe the devil! It is a word that literally means, &lt;i&gt;to throw things at people. &lt;/i&gt;The godly woman that Paul is describing is one that refuses to listen to, much less propagate, slanderous and demeaning stories about others. The law of kindness is in their mouth.

&lt;b&gt;(3)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Not given to much wine- &lt;/b&gt;Not one who has a reputation for drinking; one who sits long at drink.

&lt;b&gt;(4) Teachers of good things-&lt;/b&gt; The Greek word here is a word for &lt;b&gt;good &lt;/b&gt;that means &lt;i&gt;noble, excellent, lofty&lt;/i&gt;. And the idea in the word is not to be understood as something that takes place in a classroom, &lt;i&gt;it is the idea of being a role model or a pattern of goodnes&lt;/i&gt;s. Older women, particularly when their children are grown and gone and they reach the senior years are not supposed to just wander away from the church and travel around as if they had no responsibility. In their older years they are responsible to become teachers of the next generation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That they may teach the young women to (5) be sober, (6) to love their husbands, (7) to love their children,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(5) Sober- &lt;/b&gt;The sober minded individual is in command of their mind. It means to be serious. They have control over the things they think and thus, they have control over the things that they do. They do not allow circumstances or the immorality or foolishness of others to distract them. They not only do not become involved in things that are outright immoral and unspiritual but also avoid things that are trivial, foolish, and unproductive. The older woman's counsel enables the young woman to be occupied with Christ, to see life "with eternity's values in view", to make decisions from the wisdom of God's viewpoint.

&lt;b&gt;(6) Teach them to be lovers of their own husband&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;not someone elses husband! &lt;/i&gt;And the kind of love that is spoken of here is not necessarily the love of emotion, it's the love of will and a deep commitment. The word love in our society is used almost universally to describe the erotic or sexual aspect. &lt;i&gt;Sexual love and out side of the covenant and bonds of marriage is either fornication or adultery and has nothing to do with real, biblical love at all. &lt;/i&gt;This means that mothers and grandmothers are going to be teaching their daughters, granddaughters and unmarried women at church to &lt;i&gt;keep themselves sexually pure and reserve their bodies for their husbands in the covenant of marriage. &lt;/i&gt;Marital love needs to be taught because contrary to television, real marriage in the real world is not all about bells and whistles beloved, it is about covenant, commitment and faithfulness to one another in the sight of God. Note in the passage that &lt;b&gt;loving a husband &lt;/b&gt;in a God honoring, Christ glorifying way is something that is an ongoing lesson that is to be taught.

&lt;b&gt;(7) Children lovers&lt;/b&gt;. Women, this is your highest calling, to raise godly children &lt;i&gt;for the glory of God. &lt;/i&gt;Any woman can have children, but the goal of the Christian woman is to raise children to love The Lord, serve The Lord, and do whatever they do for His glory and honor.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Tim 3.15 from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Tim 1.5 the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(8) Discreet&lt;/b&gt;- to have sound judgment, common sense, right thinking, right priorities. Common sense stuff of life. Ladies, if you are not thinking rightly (&lt;i&gt;biblically&lt;/i&gt;), then you will not behave properly. This Greek word can be also translated self-controlled. This means that you need to be teaching your daughters by example and precept the importance of self control. If parents do not discipline themselves, they can never effectively teach discipline their children.

&lt;b&gt;(9) Chaste-&lt;/b&gt; this speaks of being morally and virtuous in mind and heart as well as in action. This is not the message that is being pounded into the hearts and minds of our precious daughters and granddaughters by society. Anything BUT purity and virtue.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Pe 3:2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Precious sisters, are you more concerned with mans approval or Gods? When you look for your acceptance first with God, that is what frees you from being in bondage to society or the person in the mirror.

&lt;i&gt;The biblical goal of a womans life is not to find the ultimate expression of the self (neither body&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;nor character). The biblical goal in life is to express the all-satisfying greatness and trustworthiness of God. Expressing God, not self, is what a godly woman wants to do. Excessive preoccupation with figure and hair and complexion is a sign that self, not God, has moved to the center. With God at the centerlike the sun, satisfying a womans longings for beauty and greatness and truth and loveall the planets of food and dress and exercise and cosmetics and posture and countenance will stay in their proper orbit.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;(10)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Keepers at home- &lt;/b&gt;It simply means that &lt;i&gt;the sphere of a woman's life is her home, that's her domain&lt;/i&gt;. Even a cursory look at&lt;b&gt; Proverbs 31:16,18 &amp;amp; 24 &lt;/b&gt;indicates that to be a &lt;b&gt;keeper at home&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; prohibit working outside the home, but &lt;i&gt;it does indicate&lt;/i&gt; that design of God for the wife/mother is that her marriage, family and home are to be the top priority in her life.not her career. With the advent of modern technology, a non-homeschooling mother with children at school may have more time and there may be things outside the home she can do that may even be enterprising like the Proverbs 31 woman and bring in a little bit of income. But any of those kind of things that you do, the home remains the constant and ongoing priority. Everything focuses on that. That is the idea of this word..when there is a decision that needs to be made between the home and other thingsthe home and family win out. Sisters, the first time there's indication that any employment or social environment is compromising your commitment to Christ, compromising your commitment to your husband, compromising your commitment to your home, you need to change that or your marriage is in danger of becoming another statistic on the wrong side of the ledger.

&lt;b&gt;(11) Good- &lt;/b&gt;Moms, it is your responsibility to teach your daughters and granddaughters to be good. In our culture, what is being said to young women about being good is the very opposite of what young women are being taught. Young women today are being taught to love whoever they want, farm their children out to somebody else, don't worry about being sensible, do whatever pleases you. Don't worry about being good or pure, fulfill your physical and lustful desires. And now we have women in the church at an epidemic rate teaching their daughters and granddaughters by their choices, that if your marriage is not all that you want it to be, bail out, tap out, walk out.

&lt;b&gt;(12) Obedient to their own husbands- &lt;/b&gt;This is no laughing matter beloved. In the creation account of &lt;b&gt;Genesis 1&lt;/b&gt;, Gods first word on the subject of men and women is that they were equally created in the image of God (v. 27). Neither received more of the image of God than the other. So the Bible begins with the equality of the sexes. As persons, as spiritual beings standing before God, men and women are absolutely equal. In &lt;b&gt;Genesis 2&lt;/b&gt; however, there is a more detailed account of the creation of the two equal human beings that reveals &lt;i&gt;differences&lt;/i&gt; in their &lt;i&gt;God-given functions and responsibilities&lt;/i&gt;. Obedient to their own husbands is another way of expressing the wifes duty of submission in the marriage relationship (&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18&lt;/b&gt;). Ladies, the husband is the head of the house, not you.

And note &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;God instructs Christian women to live this way? &lt;b&gt;That the word of God be not blasphemed!&lt;/b&gt;

In other words, the very character and testimony of Christ in the world to some extent hinges upon the behavior of His children.
&lt;h3&gt;Closing comments&lt;/h3&gt;
I know there are a myriad of things that may flood your mind, exceptions here and there and everywhere and what a bout a woman who is single working in the world and what about a woman who has no children working, and again I just remind you, those things you need to pray about and decide in your own family and then follow the leading of the Lord

There are some precious and dear women that God wants to be single and they're the exception. He doesn't call them to be married. They have what the New Testament calls a &lt;i&gt;gift of singleness&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;First Corinthians 7&lt;/b&gt; says that women who are single should remain single, if they can do that. Some women are designed by God to be single for the Kingdom's sake.

There are some women who are barren for the Kingdom's sake, for God's divine purposes. There are some men who cannot produce children and therefore their wives will never bear children. In the early days of the church, barren women would oftentimes take their barrenness as an opportunity to adopt a child. God has designed some women to have the uniqueness of singleness and others not to have children for His own purpose. Both are precious in His sight!

The fulfilled woman, old or young, married or single, with or without children is the woman that loves Jesus Christ, serves Him and submits to His role for her in the home and in the church. The fulfilled woman is not the woman who is married to the perfect husband (&lt;i&gt;their arent any out there, I know&lt;/i&gt;!!!!) The fulfilled woman is the woman who finds her ultimate joy, peace, satisfaction and love in Jesus. &lt;b&gt;Her expectations are from Him (Psalm 62.5),&lt;/b&gt; not her husband. Remember, it is Jesus, Who said that He came to give us life and that more abundantly!

Precious sisters, do not fall for the lies of the world. Nobody can love you like Jesus Christ. Whatever your marital state is, trust Him, love Him, serve Him and bring Him glory.

		<title>Colossians 3:1-4 - Our Identity in Christ</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;strong&gt;By Pastor Ben Hiwale&lt;/strong&gt;

These first four verses of Colossians chapter 3 are a transitional text, a bridge text connecting the front of the book with the back of the book. Paul does this quite frequently in his epistles: after writing about Christology, Doctrine of Christ, Sin, Salvation, Supremacy, the person and work of Jesus Christ, he now transitions into Application - Our Identity.

This passage speaks to one of lifes biggest questions:God, what should I do with my life?

Why is it so difficult to find out Gods will for my life?Is God disinterested?Should I conclude that His plan is a mystery?

No.Gods Will for me is pretty simple, and repeated often throughout the Bible:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Salvation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rejoice&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give Thanks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dont Covet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
But what about &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; decisions that we have to make? Important questions like,what God wants me to do with my life? What is His plan for my life? What is His will for my life?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What college do I go to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who should I marry?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where should I live?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should I buy this or not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Can we really find answers to these questions?Where do I begin?&lt;!--more--&gt;

The answer is - lift up your head and look up! See who Jesus is and where He is seated at the right hand of God!

Then, instead of asking yourself, What should I do with my life? Ask, what should I do with the life that God has put within me?</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>A lowly view Christ produces superficial Christianity. When the sinner is united with Christ in his death and resurrection through faith, he enters into a vital, living relationship with Jesus Christ, with the whole personality. The motivation for living like this is four-fold:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because you have died with Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because you have been raised up with Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because Jesus Christ is your life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because you have the hope of glorification with Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You Can, You Must, You Will&lt;/h3&gt;
Christian life is not about obedience to laws. The Christian life is about obedience to Christ. The Christian life is not about conformity to an external behavior.

In Colossians 3:5, Paul lists five sins of passion, with the first three distinctly sexual in nature and the last two being the culmination of uncontrolled desires. I honestly cannot think of a more fitting list of verses that describes the present condition in our own culture. "Immorality" refers to any type of sexual activity outside of marriage. The word broadly covers the gamut from sexual improprieties, to affairs, and to perversions. Its the Greek word  Porneia, from which we get our English word, pornography. The lexographers who coined the term identified it properly, for the use of pornography in any form ultimately leads to immorality.

Need I add that there is never any good that comes out of immorality? So to be a Christian is not to have your head in the clouds but go and battle against your own sinful flesh. And when our sinful flesh rears its ugly head, we are to respond not by suppressing it or denying it. We are to respond by putting it to death!

If your car is leaking oil, if your roof is leaking and staining the ceiling, if your house is infested with bees, you go to the source and fix it!&lt;!--more--&gt;

The Bible is concerned with the sickness, the disease itself. If you treat the disease, the symptom will be eliminated. So if symptoms are all you are addressing in your life: dont do that, dont think that, and dont say that. You will never overcome the sinful impulses of the flesh.
&lt;h3&gt;It's a Heart Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
Jesus came to address the human heart, not human behavior. He came to deal with the unseen nature of humanity. God did not come to make us good boys and girls. He came give us new natures. In Colossians 3:8-9 once again Paul lists a sequence of activities.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anger is something that builds within us. It usually comes because we are frustrated that we are not getting our way about something.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rage is the boiling over of anger. It is seen in a quick-tempered person.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Malice is the bitterness that seeks to hurt another.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slander is hurtful speech that defames a person's character.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Filthy Language - When anger controls a person they often spew hurtful and vile words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Anger is a dangerous emotion. When anger grows bad things happen:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Children are abused&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lives are destroyed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People are injured or killed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Hurtful words leave scars that never heal. Relationships are shattered "Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?" (Prov. 6:27).

How many of you know someone whose life is wrecked by sexual sin? I dont know anyone who sits down and says that my 5-year goal is to have an affair; I plan on getting addicted to porn so to pollute my mind. I have never met anyone that the one thing I want is AIDS. No one plans to do something is to break up a marriage and family and yet it happens all the time. The most common thing that people say on the other side of tragedy  I never thought it will happen to me.

Ephesians 5:3 says, "But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality." The Gk word Porneia is used and what it literally means that any kind of sexual arousal outside the boundaries of marriage. There must not be a hint of that.

In today's culture, what is normal when it comes to sex? Its pain, regret, guilt, shame, insecurity, fear, lust, divorce. Up to 65% of men and 55% of women will commit adultery by the age of 40. When you add those numbers, some 80% of marriages will be affected.

I Corinthians 6:15-20 Flee sexual immorality. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? shall I take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body with her? Paul then goes back to Genesis chapter 2 to clear this up. God actually speaks to this early on so as to clear this up for us. And in verse 16  he quotes Genesis 2  The two will become one flesh.

Practically, we begin with unusual things to get unusual results
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn the warning signs of anger&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get some distance, walk away. Do some deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dress Modestly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep Four Feet on the Ground if you are dating&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No Sleepovers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid places, people that are dangerous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Watch what you Read, Watch and Listen to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Finally: Repent! - I Cor 6:20  A price has been paid. Christ is All, in All.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re 19:1 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;After these things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
The phrase &lt;em&gt;after these things &lt;/em&gt;refers to the events of chapters 17 and 18 and especially the fall of Babylon.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Here in verses 1-10, we're taken to heaven&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in that interval between the destruction of Babylon and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The word &lt;em&gt;Alleluia&lt;/em&gt;comes from two Hebrew words. The first is &lt;em&gt;allelu&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &lt;i&gt;give praise&lt;/i&gt;. The second is the Hebrew name of God in the shortened form, &lt;i&gt;Yah&lt;/i&gt;. It means praise Yahweh, or praise the Lord".

This is the only chapter that we find this word in the NT, but it is&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a title for &lt;b&gt;Psalm 111; &lt;b&gt;Psalm&lt;/b&gt;112; &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm&lt;/b&gt;113&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;which are part of the Hallel Psalms.The Hallel Psalms were sung in association with the Feast of Passover, which was a covenant celebration of Israel's deliverance out of Egypt.The word Hallelujah is a word that was either spoken or sung by the people of God to describe the joy of their being delivered from their enemies by the mighty hand of God.

If you have repented of your sin and trusted in Him as full atonement for you sin debt, than you can declare a hearty Alleluia right now! For God Himself has &lt;b&gt;delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Col 1.13).&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This Alleluia is the four-fold declaration that &lt;b&gt;salvation and glory and honor and power belong to our God&lt;/b&gt;.This anthem of praise reminds us of &lt;b&gt;1 Chronicles 29:11.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty. Indeed, everything that is in the heavens and the earth, Thine is the dominion, O Lord, and Thou dost exalt Thyself as head over all. Both riches and honor come from Thee and Thou dost rule over all. And in Thy hand is power and might. It lies in Thy hand to make great and to strengthen. Now therefore, our God, we thank Thee and praise Thy glorious name."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Salvation belongs unto our God&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jonah 3.9 Salvation is of the LORD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glory and honor belongs unto our God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
The Psalmist put it this way:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto Thy Name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ro 11:36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power belongs unto our God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Before Jesus ascended up into heaven, He said&lt;b&gt;, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." (&lt;b&gt;Matthew 28:18)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Heaven confirms that sound theology will always be God and Christ centered and not man centered. As glorious and wonderful as the redemption of man is, the major theme of Scripture is not the redemption of man, but The Redeemer of Man.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isa 44:6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:2 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;religious Babylon and all that belong to her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Back in &lt;b&gt;Revelation 7:9-14&lt;/b&gt;, we saw a &lt;b&gt;great multitude&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&lt;/b&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Revelation 6:9,10, &lt;/b&gt;we know that&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a part of this great multitude who were martyred at the hand of Antichrist during the Great Tribulation cried out for God's righteous judgment&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Here, their prayer is answered.

Please observe that there is no questioning the wisdom and ways of God in heaven. The proclamation of the people in heaven to the events that are taking place on earth judgment is a resounding &lt;b&gt;true and righteous are His judgments.&lt;/b&gt;

In a world that is reeling out of control because of their rebellion against The Living God, we must not lose heart beloved.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dan 4.35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 115.3 our God is in the heavens He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One sure way to lose your peace and become anxious and overwhelmed is by listening to squawk radio and worrying about government conspiracies that are infringing upon our rights. Beloved,
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isa 26. 3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. 4 Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14.27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
How I need to remember biblical truth about the character of God when I am in the midst of a serious trial in my life and I find myself doubting the fairness of love of God for me. In the middle of his great trial Job made the statement:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job 23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Job got his request answered and he stood before The Lord, we read:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Job 40:1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Like Asaph in &lt;b&gt;Psalm 73&lt;/b&gt;, there are times in this age when the bad guys are doing great and the follower of Jesus is getting hammered to the proverbial wall. But know this beloved, the Bible tells us that this cannot and will not always be the case because the character of God is that He is Just and True. In order to keep our spiritual sanity in an unjust world, it is vital for us to maintain a divine perspective in our lives.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev . 19:3 And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Heaven rejoices not because of the damnation of the unjust, for the prophet Ezekiel declares that :
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezek 18.23, 32).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Peter 3.9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

The atonement of Jesus Christ is a full atonement to any and every sinner who will come to Him in repentance and faith.
&lt;h3&gt;Remember the 3 Rs of the Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruin&lt;/strong&gt; by the Fall&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt; by grace through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; by the power of The Holy Spirit&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:4 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Greek says, &lt;i&gt;and they worshipped the God, the One who sits continually upon the throne&lt;/i&gt;. Oh, how we need to capture this picture of our God who sits on the throne deep within our hearts today beloved, for it emphasizes the permanent sovereignty of God.

When John was taken up into heaven, the first thing that he saw was &lt;b&gt;a throne was set in heaven, and One sat on the throne (Rev 4.2). &lt;/b&gt;There is only One Sovereign Ruler of this universe.

There is no act of man, nor of the nations, nor problem, which comes up in our lives, which overrules the sovereignty of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 103:19  The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dan 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Pe 3:22 Who (&lt;/b&gt;The Lord Jesus Christ&lt;b&gt;) is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amen &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt; means, so be it. In other words, as far as the judgment of this fallen world system goes, the verdict of the saints in heaven is &lt;b&gt;Amen&lt;/b&gt;! This &lt;b&gt;Amen &lt;/b&gt;agrees with one of the initial statements of John in the Revelation as it relates to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to judge the world in righteousness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Notice who the inhabitants of heaven consists of:&lt;b&gt;His servants and ye that fear Him.&lt;/b&gt;Jesus said,
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the titles of Jesus Himself is &lt;b&gt;Isa 42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth.&lt;/b&gt;Our example of being a servant is The Lord Jesus Christ Who served His Father and others in humility and grace.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 13.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil 2.5Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To be a follower of The Lord Jesus Christ my dear church family means that we collectively make the choice to deny ourselves and prefer others above ourselves just like our Lord did in the upper room in &lt;b&gt;John 13&lt;/b&gt; when He washed the disciples feet.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. Matthew 16:24&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Some people think denying themselves is doing without certain kinds of food, going without sleep, or doing without certain pleasures. They think maybe if they go live in a monastery they'll be denying themselves.

But Jesus didn't say deny yourself things. It's not denying yourself things; it's denying yourself. Simon Peter forsook his nets, but it was a long time before Simon Peter forsook Simon Peter. God is not going to superimpose His mighty, dynamic power on your old self-life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mr 10:42-45 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;diakonos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;): And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;doulos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The worldly spirit of loving preeminence and being superior over others is contrary to the teaching and example of Jesus Christ and has no place within His church.Arrogance, pride, self-exalting attitudes are not the fruit of a born again child of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev 19;6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Hendels Hallelujah chorus was inspired by this text of Scripture.

Beloved, please note the language that is used to describe the workings of God from the throne and the volume of praise that is continually brought before Him. I really hope that you are not expecting heaven to be like the public library!

While there is something precious and irreplaceable about our quiet times alone with God, there is also something absolutely thrilling about a large number of Christians worshipping God with sincere enthusiasm.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The word omnipotent here in Greek is&lt;em&gt; Pantokrator&lt;/em&gt; (Gk.) almighty; absolute and universal sovereign. God alone is all-powerful, invincible, unstoppable, and supreme. &lt;b&gt;Psalm 93.1, 97.1&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;99.1&lt;/b&gt; all declare that &lt;b&gt;The Lord reigns.&lt;/b&gt;Your God is reigning in your life right now beloved. Just like Job that I mentioned earlier. Joseph told his brothers that they very same things that they meant for his evil, God used for good and His glory. God reigns beloved!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;glory&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) to him:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Giving glory to God is the language of the redeemed, whether they are in heaven or on earth.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Ti 1:17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jude 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Co 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Throughout the New Testament, the figure of a husband and wife is used to depict the relationship of Christ to His church, particularly in &lt;b&gt;Ephesians 5. &lt;/b&gt;Paul said to the Corinthians that I have espoused you unto the husband, unto Jesus Christ, and I have a godly jealously over you because my desire is to present you as a chased virgin unto Him. In other words, we are to be fully and completely devoted unto our husband Jesus Christ. We are not married to any particular denomination, we are married to Jesus Christ. Our worship is to be directed to Him. We know from Jesus answer to the what is the great commandment question as well as His condition for discipleship in &lt;b&gt;Luke 14 &lt;/b&gt;that our love for The Lord God must exceed all other loves. And if there develops in our life a love for something or some experience that exceeds our love for the Lord, we are committing adultery, because our first love is to be to Him and for Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;righteous acts of the saints&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Many of the newer translation translate the latter part of verse 8 something like this. &lt;b&gt;The fine linen is the righteous deeds (ESV) &lt;/b&gt;or&lt;b&gt; righteous acts (NKJV) &lt;/b&gt;or&lt;b&gt; good deeds of Gods holy people (NLT).&lt;/b&gt;

Does this mean that we are saved by our good deeds? No, our righteousness before God is not based upon our performance. Our righteousness before God is not something that we earn by observing particular rules or rituals, thus making us a part of our salvation. It is not our righteousness that saves us for our righteousness is as flighty rags in the sight of God. Our righteousness is an imputed righteousness that comes by embracing what Jesus Christ has already done for us by grace through faith.

What we see in the totality of Scripture is the reoccurring theme of the balance between salvation by grace &lt;i&gt;apart&lt;/i&gt; from works (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 1:17; 3:21, 22, 24-26; 10:4; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:9&lt;/b&gt; ), &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the corresponding fruit of works of faith as the evidence of that salvation (&lt;b&gt;1 Thess. 1:3; 1 Tim. 1:5; James 2:14, 19, 20,26; 2 Peter 1:5-8&lt;/b&gt;).

So, on the divine side, salvation is all of God who "grants" us the righteousness of Christ through faith. On the practical side, we see that the fine linen, which will be worn by Christ's bride, is made up of the "righteous acts of the Saints which were done out of a pure love for Him and for His glory and honor.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19;9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Himself eagerly anticipates this marriage supper. He spoke longingly of the day when He will drink of the fruit of the vine again, with His disciples in the kingdom (&lt;b&gt;Matthew 26:29&lt;/b&gt;).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 14:16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: 17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Blessed are those who are called unto the marriage supper of The Lamb. Woe unto those who refuse the invitation to come. Note that some people who were bidden to come to the supper began to make excuses. What is your excuse for surrendering your life totally to Jesus Christ today my friend? Your unsaved spouse? Your friends? Your career? Your pet sins?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev. 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In this passage and in &lt;b&gt;Re 22:7,8&lt;/b&gt;, the apostle offers worship to a fellow creature, an angel. In each place the prohibition is prompt. This episode is introduced in order to teach the sinfulness of all creature worship.
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worship God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Jesus tells us how to worship God:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 4.20-26 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The only way to worship God in Spirit and In truth is by coming to Him by grace through faith in His Son Jesus Christ. No man comes unto The Father apart from faith in Jesus Christ (&lt;b&gt;John 14.6&lt;/b&gt;). No man comes to The Father except The Father draws him (&lt;b&gt;John 6.44&lt;/b&gt;).

How does The Father draw a sinner to His Son?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 10.11-17 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>Colossians 3:12-17</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>My dear friend and colleague Pastor Ben has taken us through the put off or mortify section found in Colossians 3.5, 8 &amp;amp; 9 &lt;a title="Colossians 3: 5-11" href="/colossians-3-5-11/"&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;. Those things that we are told to put off are fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desires, covetousness, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication and lying. In Eph 4.22, these sins (like any sin) are called deceitful lusts.

&lt;em&gt;Take heed of accounting any sin small, lest at last you account not any sin great.&lt;/em&gt; Samuel Annesley

The word deceitful describes something that is misleading; something that cheats you. That is what sin is and that is what sin does, beloved. Sin misleads you, it lies to you, blinds you, and at the end of the day, it robs you. It has been said that sin will take you further than you thought it would and cost you more than you thought. These things that The Holy Spirit tells us to put off is because they are the very things that destroy integrity, reputation, marriages and ministries. They are the very things that are destroying the very moral fiber of our nation.

Beloved, sin is not bad because it is forbidden, sin is forbidden because it is bad. Every single "thou shalt not" in Scripture is Gods way of saying to you and me, do not harm yourself. So much for the put off part of our walk, lets look at what we are called to put on....
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.12-14 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things, put on love which is the bond of perfectness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Verses 12-14 are one of the divine imperative put on sections that we find in the New Testament. It is our responsibility to put these garments of the new man that we are in Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ro 13:12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eph 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This put on section of Colossians should be read in conjunction with Eph 4.22-32. Please note in verse 12 that before we are exhorted to put on the new garments of the new man that we are in Christ, The Holy Spirit first describes those who are saved as being the elect of God, holy and beloved. What does the word elect mean? Strongs Concordance tells us that the Greek word &lt;em&gt;eklektos&lt;/em&gt;; means to select; by implication, favorite:  chosen, elect. This Greek word is found in the AV 23 times and is translated "elect" 16 times, and "chosen" 7 times; picked out, chosen by God, to obtain salvation through Christ.

No one is converted solely by his own choice, but only in response to Gods effectual, free, uninfluenced, and sovereign grace. In Romans 11.5 &amp;amp; 6 it is made crystal clear that election is always according to the grace of God. The words elect and election are Biblical terms that are rooted in the unconditional love and grace of God towards sinners. These are words that inflame and infuriate many people, but they are Spirit inspired words that are just as much a description of followers of Jesus as are the words bride, sheep, household of faith, body of Christ etc. They are not words that are the exclusive possession of 5-point Calvinists, or hard core Sovereign Baptists or fundamental Presbyterians. They are Spirit inspired Biblical Words beloved that describe each and every person who has repented of their sin and trusted in Jesus Christ.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Though a mystery to the natural man and our finite minds, divine election and human responsibility are both taught in the Bible and are not rivals in Gods economy. Neither are they mysterious truths that are to be debated, for both are true. Do not stand still disputing about election, set to repenting and believing. Cry to God for converting grace. Revealed things belong to you; in these busy yourself. Whatever Gods purposes may be, I am sure His promises are true. Whatever the decrees of heaven may be, I am sure if I repent and believe I shall be saved.&lt;/em&gt; Joseph Alleine

&lt;em&gt;The arms of Christ are always open to receive a perishing sinner fleeing to Him for refuge. If there be no way to heaven but one, then fly unto it without delay, never perplexing yourself with the decrees and secrets of God.&lt;/em&gt; Anthony Burgess

God does not elect anybody who does not choose to follow Christ. What does it mean to be holy and beloved? In this context, the word holy means that God has divinely separated those who are saved in order that we might be consecrated and devoted unto The Lord Jesus Christ, set apart for The Master's use. Jesus told the 12, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit." Practically speaking, being holy is the fruit of living in fellowship with Jesus Christ; and, that holiness is demonstrated within the context of our everyday lives in this world.

What does it mean to be His beloved? Because we are the bride of Christ, it means that we are the objects of His special love and grace. We are beloved because we are married to The One of Whom The Father declared this is My Beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased. This is beautifully typified in the Song of Solomon, I am My beloveds and My beloved is mine.

&lt;em&gt;Who can truly view the cross of Jesus and not purpose to be conformed into His image? Who would want to deliberately choose to continue in his or her old sinful patterns of living when it is clear that on His cross, Jesus died as well to deliver us from those sinful patterns that we are told here to put off. When people truly comprehend the holiness of Jesus, they desire to be holy also as He is holy by putting off the old man and putting on the new man which has been created by Him in righteousness and true holiness. There can never be a true revival within the church or a true extension of the gospel to the lost as long as we send the confusing and unscriptural message of the grace of that makes wages no war against the flesh and makes absolutely no practical difference in the way a Christian and non Christian live.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;It is most significant to note that every one of the graces listed has to do with personal relationships between man and man. There is no mention of virtues like efficiency or cleverness, not even of diligence or industry--not that these things are unimportant. But the great basic Christian virtues are those that govern human relationships. Christianity is community. It has on its divine side the amazing gift of peace with God and on its human side the triumphant solution of the problem of living together.&lt;/em&gt;William Barclay

Once again, what are the things that we are told to put on?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.12-14 Bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things, put on love which is the bond of perfectness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Bowels of mercies.&lt;/strong&gt; "A heart of compassion" (Revised Version). Jesus, as Son of Man was moved with compassion as He looked out at the multitudes that did not have a relationship with God. They were like sheep without a shepherd. This being moved with compassion, He taught them, and He touched them. It is the opposite of being hard or mean spirited.

&lt;strong&gt;Kindness.&lt;/strong&gt;Gr. &lt;em&gt;Chrestotes&lt;/em&gt;; goodness of heart. Translated "gentleness" in Gal 5.22 and "goodness" in Rom 2.4; 11.22. It is the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate. It describes a person that delights in contributing to the well being of others, by seeking to help supply their needs or alleviate their distresses. Agape is kind...1 Cor 13. It is the opposite of rude, nasty.

&lt;strong&gt;Humbleness of mind.&lt;/strong&gt;(Phil. 2:1ff). Lowly or modest. This is called, the mind of Christ. Humility is a low estimation of self in light of the revelation of the holiness of God. Humility is cultivated by living in the presence of God at all times [Isa 6; Acts 17.28]. It is the opposite of being proud or haughty, high minded, arrogant or assuming.

&lt;strong&gt;Meekness. &lt;/strong&gt;Power under control. Jesus said, Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. Meekness is not weakness; it is power that is under the control of the Spirit of God. It is the opposite of self willed, stubborn.

&lt;strong&gt;Long suffering.&lt;/strong&gt; This word is literally long-temper. This is a godly response in the face of unholy provocation. It is the fruit of the Spirit that enables us to endure wrongs or difficulties for the glory of God. God has been longsuffering towards our rebellious planet now for 2000 years!

As I go down this list, I find that each one of these is a description of Jesus. And Jesus manifested each of these characteristics in the 4 gospels. Because I know that Raymond Viola does not have the capacity to naturally bring forth these kinds of things in my life, I find my heart crying out, Father God, by the power of Your Holy Spirit, help me to be this kind of a man! I want to be like Jesus!

As I go down this list, I see that The Holy Spirit plants me in relationships and places me in circumstances in order that I would lean upon His grace and strength to be a merciful, kind, forgiving, humble, meek, longsuffering, forbearing and loving person. Each one of the qualities mentioned in this passage express themselves in relationships. A significant measure of our Christian life is found simply in how we treat people.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.13- Forbearing one another and forgiving one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Greek word here for forgiveness occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, fault found, blame, censure; and here denotes occasion of complaint. The idea is, that if another person has given us just occasion of complaint, we are to forgive him. As long as we are in these unredeemed bodies, and as long as there is corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise in our homes, in our marriages and in the local church. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness that we have received through Jesus Christ. What is the standard of forgiveness? Even as God for Christs sake forgave us.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ephesians 4.32. How did Jesus forgive you, me, us? (1) freely---he did not hesitate or delay when we asked him; (2) entirely--he pardoned all our offences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If God were not willing to forgive sin, heaven would be empty. No Christians are so perfect that they will never offend another person, saved or unsaved. It has been said that he must have no friends, that will have a friend with no faults, and consequently they stand in need of forgiveness from each other. What if someone offends me and does not admit that they are wrong or are sorry? If we intend to walk close to Christ and grow in grace, we must forgive them, dear ones. It does no good for the offended person to hold on to the hurt and bitterness that others have done to them. In fact, when we refuse to forgive, that bitterness and hatred will hold us in bondage and torment. Holding on to bitterness is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.

How can I know that I have really forgiven someone who has hurt me? It will be evident by a lack of bitterness and resentment towards the offending party, and a willingness to restore the relationship at the slightest evidence of repentance.

&lt;em&gt;Life lived without forgiveness becomes a prison.&lt;/em&gt; William Arthur Ward

Remember the parable of Jesus in Matthew 18 about the unforgiving servant and what happened to him. The heaviest load any man carries on his back is a pack of grudges.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Colossians 3.14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Above all these things, love is the bond of perfectness. We see this sentiment expressed in 1Cor 13. The greatest of these is love (1 Cor. 13:13). Bond of perfectnessan upper garment which completes and keeps together the rest, which, without it, would be loose and disconnected. All the Christian graces are bound together in love. Love is meek, longsuffering and kind.

It is worth noting that in 1 John, the truest evidence of being born again is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by The Holy Ghost, not the gifts of The Spirit. The great commandment, the fruit of The Spirit, the bond that knits our souls together, the only motive for which a person will be rewarded is love! To love God with all the heart, soul, mind, and strength, and one's neighbor as one's self, is the perfection that the new covenant requires. Jesus said in John 13.34 that our love for one another is to be 'even as I have loved you.'

&lt;em&gt;For all who are serving in any area of ministry either inside or outside the walls of this church, If love be the sum and fulfilling of the law, love must be the sum and fulfilling of our ministry.&lt;/em&gt; Richard Baxter
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Some transcripts read "the peace of Christ". This is a peace rooted in the gospel (Romans 5.1). The original word for "rule" signifies to umpire, or to act the part of an umpire, as in the Olympic games. This peace of God is a peace that comes from above (James 3) and is meant to be the deciding factor of every temper, affection, thought and decision. The peace of God is to rule in our hearts and rule in our church family. This peace is that divine ingredient that will thus calm down every agitated element of the soul; subdue the tumult of passion, and preserve the mind in healthful action and order.

Note that we are called to this rule of peace. No heart is right with God or in the will of God where the peace of Christ does not rule. However, we know from Jeremiah 17.9 that our hearts are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. We must beware of a false peace in the heart. Jonah deliberately disobeyed God, yet he was able to go to sleep in the hold of a ship in a storm! When someone says they have peace about something that contradicts the Word, they are self-deceived. I have a peace about leaving my wife or leaving my husband or working under the table or doing drugs in the privacy of my own house. The peace of God will never contradict the wisdom of the revealed will of God.

&lt;strong&gt;Be ye thankful&lt;/strong&gt;. Thankfulness is the opposite of grumbling. How precious and healthy it is when a spirit of thankfulness exists in either a family or a church. In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dwell.&lt;/strong&gt; Where is God's Word to dwell? Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee. Ps 119:11 Dwell means to live in or to be at home. Scripture should permeate every aspect of the believers life and control every thought, word, and deed.

&lt;strong&gt;Richly.&lt;/strong&gt; In the largest measure, and with the greatest value; so as to fill and govern the whole soul. That is why we place a high priority here at Koinonia Fellowship on prayer and the preaching, teaching and study the Word. Another description given to the Holy Scriptures is that they are the word of Christ, because they have (1) Christ for their author, (2) Christ for their object, and (3) Christ for their end. In the volume of the book it is written of Me to do Thy will, O God.

The Great Commission is not only proclaiming the gospel to the lost, it is making disciples by teaching the Word of God. We study the Scriptures together in order that we might become rich in our understanding and in our knowledge of God. As I have said before, we come here to hear God speak about God, not man speak about man.

In addition to teaching, another way that Scripture dwells in our hearts is in when we are signing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. There is a definite relationship between our knowledge of the Bible and our expression of worship in song. Psalms were, of course, the songs taken from the Old Testament. For centuries, the churches in the English-speaking world sang only metrical versions of the Psalms. Hymns were songs of praise to God written by believers but not taken from the Psalms. Spiritual songs were expressions of Bible truth other than in psalms and hymns. Teaching and admonishing are to be present in the songs that we sing.

The purpose of Worship and Christian music is much more than pleasing the ear. It was not given primarily for enjoyment, but for edification. The ultimate purpose of the gift of music and melodies is that our hearts and minds be fully engaged on the glory, majesty, love and beauty of The Lord. Thus, we are exhorted to sing with grace in our hearts to the Lord. Without grace in the heart, there is no real worship to God at all.

Christians are forever engaged in worship wars. Some say that only vocal worship is true worship. Others forbid the use of electric pianos or guitars. I am going to give you the RJV version. Whether with instrument or with voice or with both it is all for naught if the adoration and awe for Jesus Christ is not in the heart.

Compare 3:1518 with Eph. 5:1822, and you will see that being filled with the Word produces the same blessings as being filled with the Spirit. To be filled with the Spirit means to be controlled by the Word. Those two realities, The Spirit of God and The Word of God are really one. The Holy Spirit fills the life controlled by His word. This indicates that the filling of the Spirit is not some ecstatic or emotional experience, but a steady controlling of our lives as we walk in obedience to the truth of Gods word. Proverbs 1.23
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Col 3.17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What this verse is telling us is that all our thoughts, words and actions, must and ought to be done in keeping with the character of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight O Lord. To speak or do anything in His Name means that
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We do all that we do in the power and strength of Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We do all that we do for the honor and glory of Christ&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We do all that we do after the pattern and example of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1Cor 10.31Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When you set yourself to your day's work or approach any activity in the world, let HOLINESS TO THE LORD and the glory of God be written upon your hearts in all that you do.
&lt;h2&gt;Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
How do you intend to apply this section of Scripture to your life beloved? What part of the new garments in Christ do you see The Lord seeking to develop in your life? What people or circumstance is He using to bring this to pass? Is there someone in your life that God is telling you to forbear with or forgive? Remember, these are both verbs.do not delay in acting on it.

How is your peace level these days saints? Is the peace of Christ ruling in your hearts? If there is a lack of peace in your life, why?

How about being thankful? Do you have the attitude of gratitude or are you always grumbling and murmuring about this or that, him or her? Are you doing what you do in The Name of Jesus and for His glory?

Last but not least, let me ask you this. Are you saved? Have you been born again by The Spirit of God? Perhaps you are thinking that if I am the elect of God, then no matter what I do, I will end up in heaven. You do not understand the biblical meaning of election. The doctrine of Election was never meant to destroy mans responsibility for the state of his own soul. The Bible everywhere addresses men as free-agents, as beings accountable to God, and not as mere logs, and bricks, and stones. It is false to say that it is useless to tell men to cease to do evil, to learn to do well, to repent, to believe, to turn to God, to pray. Everywhere in Scripture it is a leading principle that man can lose his own soul, that if he is lost at last it will be his own fault, and his blood will be on his own head.

The same inspired Bible which reveals this doctrine of Election is the Bible which contains the words, Why will ye die, O house of Israel?  Ye will not come unto Me that ye might have life.  This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (Ezek. xviii. 31; John v. 40; iii. 19.) The Bible never says that sinners miss heaven because they are not Elect, but because they neglect the great salvation, and because they will not repent and believe. The last judgment will abundantly prove that it is not the want of Gods Election, so much as laziness, the love of sin, unbelief, and unwillingness to come to Christ, which ruins the souls that are lost.

Today is the day of salvation. If you are uncertain or unsure about the state of your soul, &lt;a href="mailto:rviola@koinoniafellowship.com"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to talk with youpray with you...</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Prayer for the Saints</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;This morning we will be looking at the first of two Spirit-filled prayers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;that Paul prays for the saints at Ephesus (Ephesians 1:15-20). These prayers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;like all the prayers in the bible, can be used to help us in our prayer lives. In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;fact, I would say that one reason why God has preserved them for us is so we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;might pray them as well. Paul prays that they would be given spiritual wisdom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;and revelation knowledge of who Jesus Christ is. Take note that what we need&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;in order to grow in our fellowship with Jesus is not just academic knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;In the gospels we read of demons knowing who Jesus is. That is certainly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;not the kind of knowledge that Paul is praying for. Now bible programs on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Jesus Christ may be incredibly edifying to read and meditate on, but thats not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;the same as experiencing His presence in our lives. I believe it was Thomas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;aKempis who said, I would rather experience the love of Jesus than simply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;know how to define it. Amen and Amen. That is what Paul is asking The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Father to give to His adopted sons and daughters here in our study.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Knowing Christ in a real and intimate way is the very basis of the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Christian life. The prophet Jeremiah said, Thus saith the LORD, Let not the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the LORD which exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color: #222222" /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;delight, saith the LORD. Our precious Lord Jesus said,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. Nearly thirty years after being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;born again, the apostle Paul prays, that I might know Him. It is to that end that Paul then goes on to proclaim the resurrection and ascension power of Jesus Christ that makes this relationship with Him possible.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Therein is a key to spiritual growth: looking unto Jesus, The Author and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #222222"&gt;Finisher of our faith. Instead of looking at the tools or means that God has provided for us to grow, as wonderful as they are, they in and of themselves have no power to turn us into mature followers of Jesus Christ. We need revelation knowledge of the Person and glory of Jesus Christ. May The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ grant to us that personal revelation knowledge of Jesus Christ.&lt;/span&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>In Hard Times, Dont Harden</title>
		<link>https://selahonradio.com/?p=6775</link>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>The times that you and I live in are indeed quite perplexing.  Distress of nations with perplexity could be the front page headline of any paper on any newsstand.  The ripple effect of sin has affected our planets morals and economy as well.  These days are indeed trying ones.
     	
Many believers, to some degree, are battling this flood of iniquity; whether it be a personal struggle, a marital valley, loss of health, financial woes, etc.  These storms of life hit us all.  None are exempt.  It is very important how we react in the midst of our storms. 
     	
Job, we are told, is an example of patience during the hardships of life.  Likewise, Scripture tells us that the end of the Lord is that He is very pitiful and of tender mercy.  If you need a refresher course on Jobs hardships, read the first two chapters of the book that bears his name.
     	
A few things are amazing to me about this man of faith.  Yes, like each one of us, he too had his bouts with despair and asked himself the Why, God questions. Yet, how different was Jobs response to his wifes question and challenge.  When their whole life went down the tubes, Mrs. Job said: Do you still hold fast to your integrity?  Curse God and die!  In contrast to his emotions, Job recognized the sovereignty of God in both giving and taking and, though in sorrow, worshipped God.  
     	
In chapter 9, Job asks an interesting question: Who has hardened against Him and prospered?  American-made Christianity is very soft.  If we are painfully honest, we must admit that many of us are fair weather believers.  When the wind of Gods blessing is blowing in our direction we are full of song and understanding, and full of faith.  However, when the direction changes and the storm clouds are upon us, we become edgy, harsh, and usually full of anxiety.
     	
Let me tell you something.  We may not like the cup that we are drinking today, but one thing we absolutely cannot afford to do is harden our hearts against God.  Mark it well, the person that hardens his heart towards God is softening his heart towards rebellion.  Though its easy to praise Jesus when all is well, and equally easy to get mad at God when things arent so well, may we learn to offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name. (Heb 13:15)  
     	
Afflicted?  Merry?  Sick?  Whether abased or abounding, remember the price for hardening your heart is far more expensive than the cost of absolute surrender to Christ.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>If I were to summarize the texts we will be covering in this post, I would have to say it is an exhortation to continue praying, continue walking and continue proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After addressing bondservants in the end of Chapter 3, Paul moves on to speak to their masters. Of course we know that when Paul wrote this letter it wasnt divided into chapters and verses. Thus, many bible commentators and teachers correctly indicate that this verse really belongs to the material in the closing words of the previous chapter. It contains a final word to masters of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many secular historians estimate that at the height of the Roman Empire's power, over one-half of the population consisted of slaves; and as such they comprised a large portion of the early Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thus, the Church was made up of those who were slaves as well as those who were masters of slaves; and therefore it was important for masters to remember that in the body of Christ there is no caste system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Any and all who are in Christ are on an equal level regardless of social strata. Yes, there are distinctions of callings in the church and order within the home for functional purposes, but we all have the responsibility to treat one another in Christ with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thus, the instruction to masters of slaves was that they were to act toward them in a way that was just and fair, always keeping in mind that they, too, have a master in Heaven before Whom they will one day stand and give an account for the stewardship which was entrusted to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The contemporary admonition of this principle would be directed towards a business owner or a supervisor at a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;4.2-4 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; Withal praying also for us (Paul, Timothy &amp;amp; Epaphras), that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continue.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Greek word for continue means to be courageously persistent or to hold fast and not let go. The NASB reads devote yourselves to prayer. The NKJV reads continue earnestly in prayer. In context, it  refers to the importance of persistent prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These words echo the words of Jesus found in Luke 18.1 that men always ought to pray and not lose heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus told the parables of the friend at midnight (Luke 11:58) and the unjust judge (Luke 18:18) to encourage us as His children to be persistent in prayer. (Cp. Acts 1:14; Rom. 12:12; Eph. 6:18; 1 Thess. 5:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If both public and private prayer characterized Jesus life, and He was God Incarnate, how much more do believers need to pray for the gospel, for themselves, and for one another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being watchful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; In its most general sense, this means to stay awake while praying, rather than being vague and unfocused. NASB keeping alert. NKJV being vigilant. Cf. Matt. 26:41; Mark 14:38; Luke 21:36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because we are prone to mentally wander off into lala land when we are praying, this is reminding us that we need to guard both against mechanical babbling and vague thinking in our prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kenneth Weusts NT Word studies beautifully states that the heart must be awake, if the prayer is to have any value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With thanksgiving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Being thankful should always accompany prayer, for it places each and every one of us in our proper place before God. Prayer is one of the benefits of the redemption that has been given unto us through The Lord Jesus Christ. Prayer is a gift from God that enables every single child of God direct access to the throne of grace in time of need. It is also a precious gift that enables us to hold sweet communion with The Living God 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The 3 fold content of Pauls prayer request&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apostle Paul requests prayer for three things related to his ministry: (1) he requests prayer for an open door to preach (cf. Acts 14:27; I Cor. 16:9; II Cor. 2:12; Rev. 3:8); (2) an ability to explain the mystery of the gospel; and (3) the ability to speak the gospel clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Jesus shouted the words from the cross, It is Finished, the work of atonement was finished, but the churches work of reaching the world with His gospel had just begun. The last words of Jesus before He ascended to The Father related to getting the gospel out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mark 16.15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Act 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Three practical observations from Col 4.3; Mark 16.15 &amp;amp; Acts 1.8 (1) The Great Commission of proclaiming the gospel is not a suggestion, but a command (2) Prayer is the means that God uses to open the doors for the gospel to be proclaimed. (3) The ability to proclaim the gospel with power comes from the indwelling Spirit of God, not the intelligence or wisdom of man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So we have set before us today a divine mandate; a promise of divine empowerment; and last, but not least, the means whereby God provides the open doors and power to proclaim this divine mandateprayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Would you once again so kindly notice that Paul asks for prayer to speak the mystery of Christ, and to proclaim Him openly and unashamedly, as he ought to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mystery of Christ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  As we have already learned in previous studies, a mystery in the bible is something that was hidden or veiled in the OT that is now revealed by The Spirit in the NT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Earlier in this Epistle to the Colossians, Paul has made clear that the essence of the mystery of Christ is God's redemption of mankind (Chapter 1:13-14, 21-23), our reconciliation to Him (Chapter 1:19-20) and ultimately Christ in us, the hope of our glory (1:26-27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The mystery as spoken of in Ephesians 3:6, is referring to the revelation that the Gentiles are to be grafted into one body with the Jew in the mystical body of Christ, the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Why is Paul in prison? For proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ. Even though he is incarcerated for the crime of proclaiming the gospel, Paul not only requests prayer for an open door, but also for boldness to speak the truth, as he ought to speak it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I believe it is important for us to know that an open door from God does not always mean smooth sailing without any opposition or difficulty. A cursory study of evangelism in the book of Acts proves this point. A great and effectual door is opened unto me and there are many adversaries (1 Cor 16.9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rather than keep quiet, which would make life much easier for himself, Paul is asking for prayer to be faithful in spite of the consequences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, are you and I in spite of the circumstances followers of Jesus Christ? Mark it down on the tablets of your heart beloved; If you have counted the cost to seriously follow Christ. If you have chosen to submit to the Lordship of Jesus Christ over human loyalty, the cross over the pleasures of this world, inevitably, there is going to be opposition and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;How are we to make the mystery of the gospel known?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1Th 2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let me ask you a couple of questions. (1) How do you please men when talking to them about the gospel or the things of The Lord? Answer? By telling them what they want to hear? (2) How do you please God by telling others about the gospel or things of The Lord? Answer? By telling people what they need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Basically, what is the gospel? Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures. He was buried and rose again from the dead on the 3rd day according to the Scriptures. He and He alone is The Way, The Truth and The Life and no man comes unto The Father but through Him. That salvation is b y grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone apart from works lest any man should boast. We are all sinners by nature and by choice, and unless we repent of our sin and trust solely in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ for full payment for our sin, we will be eternally separated from God forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;4.5 Walk (order ones behavior) in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Them that are without.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This refers to unbelievers. Ephesians 5.15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 16. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To "redeem" means "to ransom or buy back". It suggests the idea of making a wise and sacred use of every opportunity for the light of Christ to so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dear ones, we are all called by God to live in such a way that we establish the credibility of the gospel of Jesus Christ by how we live and how we speak. In the process of living out our daily lives, we are to seize every opportunity to do good towards those without, and by doing so, promote the spreading of the gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, each and every believer is given a limited amount of time on this earth and a measured amount of resources, and that time and those resources are to be sued, spread the gospel, bless others and glorify God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;4.6 Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gracious&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;- To speak what is edifying, wholesome, fitting, kind, sensitive, purposeful, gentle, truthful, loving, and thoughtful (see notes on Eph. 4:2931).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;1Pe 3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasoned with salt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Salt in ancient times was highly valuable, as it had properties that made it a preservative, a disinfectant and an additive that enhanced the flavor of food. Just as salt not only flavors, but prevents corruption, the Christians conduct and speech should act not only as a blessing to others, but as a purifying influence within the decaying society of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practical Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continue Praying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Bible places a tremendous emphasis and importance on prayer beloved. How is your prayer life? When problems surface, or sudden emergencies or crisis happen, or an unexpected blessing comes our way, is our first response one of prayer and thanksgiving unto God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;God in His wonderful grace has given to us the gift of prayer that enables us to cast all of our cares and needs unto Him. Do we take advantage of this wonderful gift? Inviting you to come up for prayer or to pray with one another is not just something that we are supposed to do, it is a vital part of living out our faith and displaying trust in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because we have an adversary, the devil who is roaming around seeking whom he may devour and because are living in a world that is hostile to the truth of God, a vital part of the armor of God is the weapon of prayer. Prayers for one another and with one another enable us to stand when under attack of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Prayer is the heavenly support for the ongoing need for every area of ministry here within our own body and for open doors of evangelism. Not everybody is called to teach the Bible. Not everybody is called to sing in the worship band. But there is one thing that every saint is called to do, and that is pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Avail yourself to the opportunities for prayer meetings beloved. Go to the prayer room on the 1st floor and pray with other saints during services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Join and participate in our Internet prayer chain. Consider opening your home for prayer and inviting people over for prayer. Come to the church ANY day of the week during office hours and spend time praying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continue Walking or living out your faith.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, are you living out your faith in your very own home? Are you living out your faith wherever you live? Are you living your your faith wherever you work? You young people, and in particular I am speaking to those who for the first time will be leaving the nest of life with mom and dad to a secular college or university. Are you prepared to live out your faith inside and outside the classroom for The Lord Jesus Christ and the glory of God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beloved, you are either living a wasted life or a redemptive life. If you have decided to live your life for Jesus Christ and the kingdom of God, then you have chosen wisely. On the other hand, if you have made living for this world and the kingdoms of this world your focus, you have chosen a life of vanity and emptiness. What shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose his or her own soul? What will a man give in exchange for his soul?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus said, My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me and to finish His work. Make today count for Jesus Christ. Make the most of every second and every opportunity to make the most of your God and Savior. Invest your life is something that is Bigger than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Continue Proclaiming the gospel.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Purpose to be a fisher of men. Be sensitive to providence of God and how He places people around you who have yet to turn to Christ. Jesus said look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest (John 4.35). The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray that The Lord will send laborers into His harvest (Matt 9.37,38). I have heard it said that the words that Isaiah heard from the throne in chapter 6 are being said today. Who will go for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let me ask you beloved, do you know what the gospel is? Are you ready to share the gospel when the Lord opens the doors? Are you willing to share the gospel when The Lord opens the doors? Have you made yourself available to share the gospel whenever and wherever The Lord opens the doors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is highly unlikely that The Lord will use an unprepared, unwilling and unavailable person to share Christ with others. If that convicts you, and you are serious about making some changes in your life along those lines, please &lt;a href="mailto:rviola@koinoniafellowship.com"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; for prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If there is such a thing as learning something good from a bad example it would be taking a page from the evangelistic zeal of the Mormons or Jehovah Witnesses who take the time and make the effort to know what they believe inside and out and are not afraid or ashamed to speak it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Are you a follower of Jesus Christ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now the normal response when that question is asked is usually a purely academic response that goes something like this. Of course I am a follower of Jesus Christ, I asked Him into my life when I was 5 years old and I believe that Jesus Christ is The Son of God. I believe in the Trinity. I believe that Christ died on the cross for the sin of the world and that He rose again from the dead. All of this is true and biblically correct, but here is the problem.the devil believes that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Bible tells us that with the heart man believes unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. To believe with the heart, or to be born again means to believe with my entire being. As Jesus said, eternal life is loving God with all of your heart, all of your soul, all of your mind and all of your strength. The net result of that belief is that you deny yourself, forsake living for the world and purpose to line your life up with the teaching of Scripture regardless of the cost or the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is what it means to walk on the narrow path that leads unto life. This is what it means to build your life on a solid rock and not sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Every human being has biological life. Many people have religious or spiritual life. Few people have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let me say something that is very heavy on my heart these days. When it comes to the proclamation of the gospel, the only thing that I can tell you with absolute certainty is this. If you truly repent of your sin and trust in the atonement of Jesus Christ, and by that I mean that you are trusting His death, burial and resurrection from the dead as full satisfaction for your sin, and in doing so, you will be forgiven and your name will be found in that book of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I cannot tell you if you come to Christ today that the rest of your life will be pain free or care free because that would not be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I cannot tell you that if you come to Christ today your unsaved friends or family members will accept you and stand behind you, because they may reject you and want nothing more to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I cannot tell you that you that if you come to Christ today you will never be sick another day of your life because that would not be true. I cannot tell you that if you come to Christ today, your unsaved spouse will immediately come to Christ as well or never leave you because that would not be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I cannot tell you that if you come to Christ today all of your children will walk with Christ and never stray from Him. I cannot tell you that you will never lose a job. I cannot tell you that if you come to Christ with a mound of debt that the mound will go away overnight or ever go away. I cannot promise you any of those things you because that may or may not be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But I can tell you thisif you come to Christ today with a broken and a contrite heart, He will forgive you of your sin, He will give you a new heart, He will make you a new creature, He will give you new desires and delights that you never had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jesus Christ will be with you always, through thick or thin, good times and bad times. Though others may leave you or forsake you, Jesus Christ will never leave you nor forsake you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I can promise you a love that is so strong that the Apostle Paul describes it this way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Romans 8.35-39 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>When a person is in Christ Jesus, they are bound together with the blood of Christ with a bond that is stronger than the blood of family that do not yet know Christ. It is in Christ Jesus that:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We share a common confession: we are sinners in need of grace.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We share a common confidence: that the blood of Christ cleanses us from sin and sets us free from our just condemnation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We share a common hope: that we will live forever in God's kingdom as children of God&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We share a common passion: to share the gospel with all who are lost and perishing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We share a common desire: to serve the Lord and one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Many of the last chapters of Pauls epistles are filled with personal references and salutations and greetings to fellow Christians with whom he has this precious bond. These are the brother and sisters in Christ who have been supportive of him and the ministry that God called him to. Even though Paul was gloriously apprehended by Christ and divinely empowered by The Spirit of God, God knew that Paul couldn't bear the load or responsibility of ministry by himself. Nobody ever can.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Lets look at Pauls appreciation of these precious saints as we close Colossians.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, &lt;i&gt;who is&lt;/i&gt; a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord: 8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate (&lt;/b&gt;some translations say, &lt;i&gt;that you might know about our circumstances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), and comfort your hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tychicus&lt;/em&gt;is mentioned as being with Paul on four different occasions: (1) on the way to Jerusalem toward the close of the third missionary journey (Acts 20:4); (2) in Rome at the time Colossians was written; (3) when Paul wrote to Titus in Crete before Tychicus was sent to Crete (Titus 3:12); and (4) in Rome for the last time before being sent to Ephesus (2 Tim. 4:12).

The Colossian Christians were naturally eager for authentic information concerning the welfare of Paul and others, and therefore he makes arrangements to supply that. But Paul was equally concerned about the things that they were dealing with, thus he sends a letter with his trusted friend Tychicus to comfort and encourage them. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Paul calls him a &lt;em&gt;beloved brother&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;faithful minister and fellow-servant &lt;/em&gt;in Christ. Tychicus was a dear brother and faithful servant of Jesus who served Paul in whatever practical ways he could. He was one of those 1 Cor. 4 kind of stewards that was found faithful in whatever God called him to do. There's no other way to get the work done, and Paul knew it. If the local church is to fulfill the great commission and minister to one another from the nursery to the senior citizen, there needs to be saints like Tychicus. People who love Jesus Christ and have a servant's heart and love to serve people.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of you. They shall make known unto you all things which &lt;i&gt;are done&lt;/i&gt; here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This recommendation was so necessary because &lt;em&gt;Onesimus&lt;/em&gt; had left Colossae as a heathen fugitive, having escaped from his master Philemon. Having been converted in Rome through the Gospel as preached by Paul, he was now returning to Colossae as a member of the Church, as a brother who now truly belonged in their midst.

Onesimus is not described as a runaway slave; he is described as a &lt;em&gt;faithful and beloved brother&lt;/em&gt;. John MacArthur writes: it's exciting to know that in Christ, people with a past have a past that's passed.

His name means, "&lt;i&gt;Profitable&lt;/i&gt;. Only Jesus can make our lives profitable. Here is a portion of a letter that was written from Ignatius to the church at Colosse: "Since then in the name of God I received your entire congregation in the person of Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love and your pastor, I beseech you in Christ Jesus to love him and all who are like him."

Only the transforming power of the gospel of the grace of God can turn a runaway slave into a pastor of the flock of God!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aristarchus&lt;/em&gt; of Thessalonica (Acts 20:4) was with Paul during the riot of Ephesus (Acts 19:29). Being Pauls &lt;em&gt;fellow prisoner&lt;/em&gt; meant either that Aristarchus attended Paul, or more likely, that he was incarcerated with Paul (probably also for preaching the gospel). Paul also called him a fellow worker (Phile. 24). He chose to identify with Paul and stand by his side in prison for the truth of the gospel, regardless of the price.

There are very few saints who are willing to give up the good American Christian life in order to be a prisoner and servant of The Lord Jesus Christ. It is easy to serve when things are going well, and you are feeling well. It is not so easy to serve The Lord when you are in the prisons of life, when the proverbial dung is hitting the fan, and the enemy is after you day and night. But when the going gets tough, the Aristarchus get on their knees and keep going.

I have on my desk a little plaque that a dear saint in the fellowship gave me. It is a quote from Winston Churchill: "if you are going through hell, keep going!"Every life will include prisons and persecutions; God grants you the grace to serve through it, not speed or excuses to run from it.

&lt;em&gt;Mark, the cousin of Barnabas,&lt;/em&gt; was a companion on Pauls first missionary journey (Acts 12:25). He was later Peters associate (my son, 1 Peter 5:13; cf. Acts 12:12-13). Though Mark deserted Paul on the first missionary journey (Acts 15:37-39), Paul here commended him (cf. Phile. 24), as he did later (2 Tim 4:11).

Jon Courson writes:&lt;b&gt;"&lt;/b&gt;Maybe some of you here today can relate to John Mark. God opened up a door for you and you bailed out early or just failed completely. Take heart, He that began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it. Let us not miss that fact that God used Barnabas as an instrument of restoration. Do you know somebody that has really blown a task given to them by The Lord? If so, dont be a bulldog, be a Barnabas. Dont be critical, be Christlike."
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only &lt;i&gt;are my&lt;/i&gt; fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt; was a translation for a common Jewish name, Yeshua. This companion of Pauls was also &lt;em&gt;called Justus&lt;/em&gt; (righteous), also a common name (Acts 1:23; 18:7). These threeAristarchus, Mark, and Justuswere &lt;em&gt;Jews&lt;/em&gt; (lit. of the circumcision) by either birth or conversion (proselytism). These three &lt;em&gt;fellow workers for the kingdom of God &lt;/em&gt;comforted or consoled Paul by their loving loyalty to him. &lt;em&gt;Comfort &lt;/em&gt;is the unusual word &lt;i&gt;paregoria&lt;/i&gt; (relief, consolation).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 Epaphras, who is &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them &lt;i&gt;that are&lt;/i&gt; in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Epaphras&lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; like Onesimus, was a Colossian (&lt;em&gt;one of you&lt;/em&gt;). Many scholars believe that he was probably the founder and perhaps Pastor of the church in Colosse.

Why was he in Rome? Because he had come to Rome to tell Paul the trouble that the false teachers had brought to the Colossians and to see how he could minister to Paul.

Paul described Epaphras as &lt;em&gt;a servant of Christ Jesus&lt;/em&gt; who was &lt;em&gt;laboring fervently in prayer &lt;/em&gt;(as Jacob did with the angel; Gen. 32) for the Colossians. In his physical absence from them he continued to labor fervently for them in his prayers.

The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer; it is the prayer that labors until there is a breakthrough of revival, repentance. This is the idea behind the effectual fervent prayer that availeth much.

Epaphras intercessory prayers were rising without ceasing to the Throne of Mercy, and his one thought was that God might give to the Colossian Christians the power to be perfected in their faith and sanctification.

Epaphras' prayer for the church reveals the overall theme of the rest of the New Testament as well; that believers would be mature and perfected in all the will of God. In other words, he did not want their faith to be stagnant or stale; but continually growing in grace and in the knowledge of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

&lt;em&gt;He has great zeal for you.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;zeal&lt;/em&gt; could also be translated pain. He hurts for them. That is a shepherds heart beloved.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Luke&lt;/em&gt; is called the beloved physician. He is the human author of the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts. Consider this; here is Paul, empowered by God to do powerful miracles in the Book of Acts, acknowledging the &lt;i&gt;ministry &lt;/i&gt;of Dr. Luke who traveled with him on his missionary journeys. There are some religious groups that forbid the use of doctors or medicine. There are others in the body of Christ that say that your faith is undeveloped or inferior to theirs if you need to go to a doctor. That is heresy, plain and simple.

&lt;em&gt;Demas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In Paul's final letter, 2 Timothy, one reads that Demas had forsaken Paul and fled to Thessalonica, having loved the things of this present world more than the things of Christ (cf. 3:1, 2; 2 Tim. 4:10). From being fellow laborer in Philemon, to Demas sends his greetings here in Colosse, to Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world in 2 Timothy, it is easy to see that Demas backsliding was a slow, but gradual one.

Our Christian life is like a locomotive. When we get saved, we are on fire for Jesus. We are in His Word daily, we come to church faithfully; we tell others about what Jesus has done in our lives. Then [and it happens to all of us], we get beyond that initial honeymoon phase of our walks. You do not feel that initial overwhelming hunger and thirst for the things of The Lord. You do not &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;like reading, praying, coming to church or sharing your faith. But, on the basis of the spiritual steam that you invested in your life in days past, you continue to roll down the track of life. Since you are still rolling down the tracks, you think that everything is okay. But inevitably, the steam runs out ands the engine shuts down, and you find that your desires and interests are heading in a different direction. The moral of the story? If we do not &lt;i&gt;daily&lt;/i&gt; set our affections on things above, the only alternative is to love the things of the world. It is only by a daily pursuit of the things of The Lord that we guard against the constant smiles, flatteries, and seductive spirit of this world system. Some ask, Was Demas saved? All I can say is that I would not want it to be written of me, he is in love with this present world.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The church in &lt;em&gt;Laodicea&lt;/em&gt; met in the house of &lt;em&gt;Nymphas&lt;/em&gt; and his family. In the first century no church building existed, and the Christians met in private houses. (Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19; Phile. 2).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the &lt;i&gt;epistle&lt;/i&gt; from Laodicea.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Although this apostolic epistle was addressed to the Christians at Colossae, its doctrines and admonitions were not intended for the Colossians alone. Paul expressly tells them that, after they have finished reading the letter, they should read the epistle from Laodicea.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Paul's letters became regarded as authoritative Scripture soon after they were written. (see comment that Peter makes in &lt;b&gt;2 Pet 3)&lt;/b&gt;. The letter to Laodicea has not been preserved.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There are times when each of us in ministry needs to be exhorted to be diligent in whatever God calls us to do. We can draw back in ministry due to fear, laziness, preoccupation with other things or plain old weary in well doing. Paul wrote to Timothy these words:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Tim 4.16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
"To have charge of any Christian congregation involves great responsibility, and the work should therefore be done at all times with the full realization of this solemn dignity. It is an office that requires zealous, untiringcommitment."&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Paul Kretzman Commentary

Whatever Aristarchus problem was, he was not fulfilling (completing) the work that God had called him to do. In a practical sense, God has given to every believer spiritual and natural talents and gifts that are to be used for the building up of the body of Christ. Every believer is called upon to evangelize the lost. And all that we do is to be done to the glory of God. Are you using your God given talents and gifts for the glory of God?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; with you. Amen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul doesnt remind them of his imprisonment to draw sympathy from them, but as a basis of his apostolic authority for which he was incarcerated. He mentions his imprisonment to encourage them in their walk with Christ, as he did when he wrote to the saints in Philippi.

&lt;em&gt;Grace be with you -&lt;/em&gt; Paul closes the book of Colossians with a heartfelt prayer that the unmerited favor of God would be with them in the form not only of mercy and forgiveness but of empowerment and gifting for life and ministry.

Once again we are reminded of the fact that it is by grace we begin and finish our walk with Jesus Christ.</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Introduction to Philippians</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commentator William Barclay writes about Philippi:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The city had been founded by Philip, father of Alexander the Great, and it is his name that it bears. It was founded on the site of an ancient city called Krenides, a name which means The Wells or Fountains. Philip had founded Philippi in 368 B.C. because there was no more strategic site in all Europe. There is a range of hills which divides Europe from Asia, east from west and just at Philippi that chain of hills dips into a pass so that the city commanded the road from Europe to Asia, since the road must go through the pass. This was the reason that one of the great battles of history was fought at Philippi; for it was here that Antony defeated Brutus and Cassius, and thereby decided the future of the Roman Empire.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/72613293"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Not very long after, Philippi attained the dignity of a Roman Colony. Wherever they were, these colonies were little fragments of Rome and their pride in their Roman citizenship was their dominating characteristic. The Roman language was spoken; Roman dress was worn; Roman customs were observed; their magistrates had Roman titles, and carried out the ordination ceremonies as were carried out in Rome itself. They were stubbornly and unalterably Roman and would never have dreamt of becoming assimilated to the people amidst whom they wert set. We can hear the Roman pride breathing through the charge against Paul and Silas in&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ac.16:20-21: "These men are Jews, and they are trying to teach and to introduce laws and customs which it is not right for us to observe--for we are Romans."&lt;/b&gt;

[****Word of caution regarding Barclay. He is great on history and background but highly questionable when it comes to miracles and the supernatural.]

It was in this atmosphere where people were fiercely loyal to Rome that Paul wrote the words, &lt;b&gt;you are a colony of heaven&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;(Php. 3:20).&lt;/b&gt; Just as the Roman colonist never forgot in any environment that he was to conduct himself as a citizen of Rome, these believers in Philippi must never forget that they must conduct themselves as citizens of the kingdom of God.

Beloved, the Bible tells us in &lt;b&gt;Romans 12.1,2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&lt;/b&gt;

Remember when Daniel and his 3 fellow Hebrews were in captivity in Babylon? They changed their names to Babylonian names. They changed their diet. They sought to brainwash them into thinking that they were Babylonians. Thank God that they resisted! They knew that they were not heathens, they were Hebrews.

Precious flock of Goddo not buy, believe or drink the world's Kool-aid. Christ has redeemed us from this present evil world system. You are no longer a child of this world system, you are a child of the Living God.&lt;!--more--&gt;

It was on the second missionary journey, about the year A.D. 52 that Paul first came to Philippi. Urged on by the vision of the man of Macedonia with his appeal to come over and help us, Paul had sailed from Alexandrian Troas in Asia Minor. He had landed at Neapolis in Europe, and thence made his way to Philippi. The story of Paul's stay in Philippi is told in &lt;b&gt;Acts16. &lt;/b&gt;It is worth noting that in &lt;b&gt;Acts 16.10, &lt;/b&gt;we find the word we, which means that Dr. Luke (the human author of Acts) is now writing from personal, first hand experience.

This church was the first church established in Europe. It would appear that the church was actually an answer to the prayer of the women who gathered there to pray alongside the Gangites River. Isnt it interesting that in the vision that Paul receives it is a man asking him for help, but when he arrives at Philippi, the first people that he meets are women praying.

Being led by The Spirit, Paul preached the gospel to them and The Lord graciously opened the heart of a woman by the name of Lydia who became a disciple of Jesus Christ. She was a wealthy woman who sold purple dyed goods. Many believe that the church actually began to meet in her spacious house.

Satanic opposition to the new church immediately arose in the person of a demon- possessed, fortune- telling slave girl (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:1617&lt;/b&gt;). Not wanting even agreeable testimony from such an evil source, Paul cast the demon out of her (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:18&lt;/b&gt;). The apostles act enraged the girls masters, who could no longer sell her services as a fortune- teller (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:19&lt;/b&gt;). They hauled Paul and Silas before the citys magistrates (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:20&lt;/b&gt;) and inflamed the civic pride of the Philippians by claiming the two preachers were a threat to Roman customs (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:2021&lt;/b&gt;). As a result, Paul and Silas were beaten and imprisoned (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:2224&lt;/b&gt;).

The two preachers were miraculously released from prison that night by an earthquake, which unnerved the jailer and opened his heart and that of his household to the gospel (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:2534&lt;/b&gt;). The next day the magistrates, panicking when they learned they had illegally beaten and imprisoned two Roman citizens, begged Paul and Silas to leave Philippi

The date of the letter is A.D. 63 or 64, and Paul is writing this letter as a prisoner in Rome.

It was a letter that was sent to encourage them in the trials and persecution that they were facing. Chapter 1
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 16.33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It was a letter that was sent to inform them of Epaphroditus health. He had been sent with this gift for Paul and he took seriously ill after he had arrived. Chapter 2
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 12.26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It was a letter that was sent to urge them to reject selfish ambition and to seek unity in Christ. Chapter 2; 4.2,3
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 12.10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It was a letter that was sent to encourage them to press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Chapter 3
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippians 3.8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It was a letter that was sent to thank them for their generous financial gift of support. Chapter 4
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Corinthians 8.1,2 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the many lessons that I hope to glean from in this epistle is the need for us to be sensitive to the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;providential,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;sovereign working of God in each and every one of our lives.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;

The Bible says that&lt;b&gt; God is working in you both to will and to do of Hid good pleasure (Phil 2.13). &lt;/b&gt;

In the kingdom of God, the baseline from home plate to first base is rarely a straight 90 feet. Indeed,&lt;b&gt; as the prophet Isaiah said, His ways are not our ways&lt;/b&gt;. Pauls initial path to Philippi is one of those examples of the mystery of divine providence.

When it comes to understanding the will of God for our lives, we must understand beloved the difference between the general will of God that relates to all saints, with no exception, and the specific will of God, which is for my life according to His purposes.

Examples of the general will of God would be His will regarding being thankful, praying, using our talents and resources for the glory of God. It would include the general instructions about the roles of being a husband, wife, employer or employee. You get the idea.

However, in addition to the general will of God, there is that personal or specific will of God that is indeed rooted in Biblical principles, but is a progressive, providential revelation of Gods will and purpose for me and my life. I believe that every single day, we are walking in the unfolding of the progressive, providential will of God for my life and my sanctification.

We see this clearly when we read Acts 16. It is there that we read that Paul had it in his heart to bring the gospel to Asia, after all, didnt Jesus Himself say, &lt;b&gt;preach the gospel to every nation? &lt;/b&gt;Indeed He did. That is His general will for the entire body of Christ.

Paul wanted to go to Asia, and God loves sinners in Asia, but The Lord shut the door on him. However, we see that the gospel did indeed spread to Asia, for we read the 7 letters of Jesus to the 7 churches that are in Asia. (&lt;b&gt;Revelation 1.4,11;&lt;/b&gt; chapters &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The general will of God was for the gospel to be preached to Asia, but that was not the specific will of God for Paul.

Did anything like this ever happen to you in your personal Christian experience? Have you ever had a strong desire in your heart to do something, go somewhere and the doors just seem to close left and right?

Some precious saints think that because something is very heavy on their heart that automatically means that it is Gods specific will for them to do that or go there. We learn from Scripture that just because something is in your heart that does not always mean that it is the will of God for you to do that or go there. Just ask David and Nathan (&lt;b&gt;2 Samuel 7; 1 Kings 8.17,18&lt;/b&gt;). David had it in his heart to build the temple, but it was not Gods specific will for David to build it. It was the specific will of God but for his son Solomon to build the temple, not him. Davids vision and burden for the temple was in harmony with Gods will, but it was not Gods sovereign, specific will for David.

Nevertheless, David made preparations for building the temple. In other words, David had God glorifying motives about the building of the temple. As long as the temple was built and God got the glory, David was a blessed man. In submission to the will of God, David charged his son Solomon to build the temple. He even charged the people of God to contribute towards the building the temple, but David himself did not build it because it was not Gods will for David to build it himself.

It is amazing how something like this reveals the motives of a persons heart. Over the years, many people have come to me with visions of teaching this group or doing that kind of a ministry. The vision was right on! But The Lord had another person in mind. However, when they were not the ones asked to teach the study, it amazed me that they wanted nothing to with it, in fact, many times they would speak out against it.

Hear this dear ones, &lt;b&gt;the steps of a good man are ordered by The Lord (Psa 37.23).&lt;/b&gt; However, it is equally true that The Lord orders the &lt;i&gt;stops or closed doors&lt;/i&gt; of a good man or woman. The Lord was &lt;i&gt;stopping&lt;/i&gt; Paul from going to Asia because it was Gods specific will for Paul to bring the gospel to Europe! How many people here today are of European descent?

Have you ever wondered why you were transferred to work in sunny Rochester, New York from the dark and gloomy San Diego? Have you dear college or post grad students here this morning ever wondered why you were accepted to attend RIT or UR instead of ugly places like University of Hawaii or Florida State University? Have you ever wondered why the doors are closed from you going on that mission field that you prayed for day and night?

Know this beloved, when Jesus closes a door on youit is not to harm you or condemn youit is not to make your life miserable. It one sense, it may be a heart check for you, especially if God is raising up someone else to teach or lead that study or area of ministry.

In another sense, it may be His divine way of saying, Ive got another door for you to walk through. Ive got a better door than you can ever imagine is in store for you. Beloved, do not kick against the goads of divine providence. Stop wrestling with Jesusrest in Him!!

As I said previously, there is rarely the absence of intrigue regarding the mystery of the Christian life. Paul was given the vision of a man saying &lt;b&gt;Come over and help us (Acts 16.9)&lt;/b&gt;, correct? So, when Paul lands in Philippi, does he find a man? No, he finds women praying besides a body of water and that prayer meeting turned into the church of Philippi!!

Another lesson we will see in this book is that being in the will of God does not always mean that there will smooth sailing with no difficulties, no hardships or opposition. Truth be told, that is seldom the case. At Philippi, Paul and many other Philippians suffered hard things. At Philippi, Paul was beaten and he scourged. At Philippi, Paul was put into a dark and dungy prison cell. And in all of this he was in the perfect will of God. And when they were released, they did not miss a beat in doing what God called them to do, knowing full well that bonds and persecutions awaited them. There is always opposition to the work of God, but He grants the grace and strength to press on for His glory.

Another lesson that we will learn from this epistle is that the Christian faith is to be a joyful one in spite of our circumstances. Beloved, a true relationship with Jesus Christ produces joy, even in the darkest moments, and I will explain that in a minute lest Satan begin to condemn and of you dear saints who are not feeling very joyful this morning.

Consider this, in the upper room, just prior to His being arrested and ultimately crucified, Jesus tells the apostles that they are going to be persecuted because of their love for Him and the gospel that they will share. But what else did Jesus say?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 15.11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Of course John was one of the apostles in that upper room that night. So what revelation does John pass along to Christians who had embraced Christ as Lord and were going through some of the most intense persecution at the hands of the cruel Roman Emperors near the end of the first century?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 1.4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The word joy or rejoicing is found many times in this letter. The idea that to be spiritual or holy is equivalent to being miserable, gloomy and depressed is contrary to Scripture. Let me explain.

Among the fruit of The Spirit listed in &lt;b&gt;Galatians 5 &lt;/b&gt;is joy. Lets set the record straight here this morning brothers and sisters. Biblical joy and worldly happiness is not the same thing. The root Greek words that we translate into the English word happiness indicate that &lt;i&gt;happiness depends upon the chances and changes in life&lt;/i&gt;. In other words, as long as there is money in the bank, my health is perfect, the weather is fine, the kids are all right, nobody bothers me, my team is winning, Im a happy camper. I am the easiest guy in the world to be around!!

I call this Dreamland or Disneyland Christianity! Take your pick!!

On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;or I would prefer to say, welcome back to planet earth&lt;/i&gt;, what the Bible promises to those who love God and live for Christ is joy. And what is the basis of our joy?

Biblical joy in not some giddy, Bobby McFerrin dont worry, be happy kind of a thing. A couple of Scriptures should demolish that unbiblical interpretation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 12.2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus Christ was not walking to the cross to bear our sin bloodied and beaten singing, zip a dee do dah zip a dee yah. He joy that Jesus had was not physical, it was not emotional, it was not circumstantial.

The joy that Jesus had was knowing that He was loved of The Father and that He was in the specific will of The Father.

Beloved, Christians have pain just like any other human being. We have sorrow and grief just like any other human being. We cry and get discouraged and weary just like every other human being.

Joy is the fruit of God centered, Christ exalting, Spirit inspired theology that is rooted in the truth that God is The Potter, and I am the clay, He is my loving Father and my times are in His hand.

Joy is that personal experience of the presence of Jesus Christ in my life and an absolute surrender to His providential will for my life in spite of my grief, my circumstances or my sorrows.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After Job lost nearly everything, he worshipped God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;After David lost his son, he worshipped God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Abraham was told to sacrifice his son of promise Isaac on the altar, he worshipped God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Habakkuk had joy though totally destitute of everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Joy? Paul is writing this epistle of joy from a prison cell, not the Apostolic Suite at the Sheraton in Cancun! We read in &lt;b&gt;Acts 16&lt;/b&gt; that it was at Philippi that he and Silas sang praises at midnight &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; being beaten to a pulp.

Obviously Paul and Silas expression of worship and joy was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; because of how they felt or their wonderful surroundingsPauls joy was in his relationship with Jesusthe knowledge that his life was in The Lords hands. and the assurance that when his life was over, he was going to go to be with Jesus forever! To live is Christ and to die is gain.

I have heard that the African impala can leap 10 feet high when running at full speed. But, when you go to a zoo, youll see impalas kept in areas with a 4-foot fenceWhy? Because if they cant see where they will land, an impala wont jump.

Paul knew where he was going to land after his life on earth was over saints, and therefore he could have joy.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luke 10.19,20 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy:and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 14.1-6 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions:if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Do you know for sure today my friend where you are going to land? You can be sure.

Last but certainly not least, the main reason for Pauls joy &lt;i&gt;practically&lt;/i&gt; was connected with his theology. How so? Paul knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that God was absolutely sovereign in every single event of his life. His theology impacted his thinking. He did not view life as a series of coincidences or accidents, but as a divine working of God Who was working in Him both to will and to do of His good pleasure. God was working all things together for good in Pauls life. And beloved, God is working all things together for good in your life this morning.

Remember beloved, your theology effects your attitude, and your attitude produces a holy joy that effects your actions and your vocabulary! &lt;b&gt;We are in Christ and in Him we live, and move and have our being! The &lt;i&gt;joy of The Lord&lt;/i&gt; is your strength &lt;/b&gt;beloved.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;He is our joy!&lt;b&gt; Rejoice in The Lord always, and again I say rejoice.&lt;/b&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Other than verses 13 and 19 in Philippians 4, perhaps one of the most often quoted passage from this epistle is: Being confident of this very thing, that He Who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. (Philippians 1:6) What a precious promise from God! What a powerful statement of reality! He Who has begun a good work in you, WILL complete it! He cannot fail to do so.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;If you have repented of your sins and trusted in Christ alone for your salvation, but feel like youre floundering a bit, be encouraged. Jesus said that He gives to His sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, and nobody can snatch us out of His hand. (John&lt;a&gt;10:28&lt;/a&gt;). That is security, my friend!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Servant (doulos) of Christ, as the King James and Revised Standard Versions have it; but doulos &lt;i&gt;is more than servant&lt;/i&gt;, it is slave. &lt;i&gt;A servant is free to come and go; but a slave is the possession of his master forever. &lt;/i&gt;The term servant is an expression of intense fervor and devotion.

Note that both Paul (&lt;i&gt;the older brother&lt;/i&gt;) and Timothy (&lt;i&gt;the younger brother and his disciple&lt;/i&gt;) regard themselves as servants of The Lord Jesus Christ. When Paul and Timothy call themselves the slaves of The Lord Jesus Christ, according to the culture and understanding of the term in those days, it would mean 2 things.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would mean that they are the absolute possession of The Lord Jesus Christ. Because Jesus Christ has loved him and bought them with a price (&lt;b&gt;1Cor.6:20&lt;/b&gt;), they belong exclusively to Him, and can never belong to anyone else.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It would mean that they owe absolute obedience to The Lord Jesus Christ. The slave has no will of his own. So as slaves of The Lord Jesus Christ, their one will is to submit to the will of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
They considered themselves to be the exclusive property of their heavenly Master, Jesus Christ and their one aim in life was to carry out the Lords will and work.

According to Scripture, the highest of all titles of honor is to be called the servant of The Living God. There is a Latin phrase when translated into English reads like this: &lt;i&gt;to be His slave is to be a king&lt;/i&gt;.

Jesus said, &lt;b&gt;No man can serve two masters. T&lt;/b&gt;he Greatest Master is Jesus Christ and therefore the ultimate purpose in life is found by serving Him.

Everybody in the body of Christ is called and gifted by God to serve somewhere or in some capacity within the local body. There is an unbiblical notion that the pastors, elders, deacons and their wives and perhaps a few other committed volunteers run the church. The rest of the folks just come, sit, listen, and go home. Kind of like a going-to-the-movies mentality. You file in, find a seat next to folks that you dont have any relationship with, and have no intention of having a relationship with, watch the performance, and file out.

I truly believe that this is because the church in America has become filled with a consumer mentality instead of a servant's mentality.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/73108103"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The point of the church is decidedly not to meet the needs of folks who decide to give them their business! The church is a fellowship of those who serve Jesus because He bought them with His blood. The church is to be God-centered and people-focused, not me-centered and program-focused.

Paul would write to this congregation, &lt;b&gt;For to you it has been granted for Christs sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake (1:29)&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;i&gt;its a gift&lt;/i&gt;!]. Can you picture the Philippian church taking out an ad in the local paper to market the church: Come, join our church! Youll love suffering with us! We have the best persecution program in town!

Beloved, if The Spirit of God is truly dwelling within you and me, and His ministry is to conform you and me into the image of The Lord Jesus Christ, than we will be a congregation of servants, because that is Who Jesus was.

Motives, motives, motives..but when it comes to being a servant, we also need to be careful about who our eyes are upon. When we have our eyes upon serving others, and our eyes are on those people, we will find ourselves disappointed over and over again. God wants us to keep our eyes on Him. We are servants of Jesus. He will never disappoint you. We serve for an audience of One.

The word translated &lt;b&gt;saint&lt;/b&gt; is hagios. Hagios, and its Hebrew equivalent qadowsh, are usually translated "holy". In Hebrew thought, if a thing is described as holy, the basic idea is that it is different from other things; it is in some sense set apart. In order to better understand this, let us look at how holy is actually used in the Old Testament.

When the regulations regarding the priesthood are being laid down, it is written: &lt;b&gt;They shall be holy to their God&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Lev.21:6&lt;/b&gt;). The priests were to be different from other men, for they were set apart for a special function.

The tithe was the tenth part of all produce which was to be set apart for God, and it is laid down: &lt;b&gt;The tenth shall be holy to the Lord, because it is the Lord's&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Lev.27:30,32&lt;/b&gt;). The tithe was different from other things which could be used as food.

The central part of the Temple was the Holy Place (&lt;b&gt;Exo.26:33&lt;/b&gt;); it was different from all other places.

The believers at Philippi here are called saints, because by virtue of Christs perfect sacrifice and their faith in Him, they are set apart for God, or sanctified by his Spirit for His exclusive use and purposes within the body of Christ here on earth.

Contrary to the traditions and beliefs of some people, &lt;i&gt;all believers&lt;/i&gt; in Jesus are saints, not just a select few. Sainthood is not an achievement, it is a position that we have through faith in Jesus Christ.

Every Christian is positionally perfect in Christ Jesus, while at the same time, we are conditionally imperfect, and in a life long phase of being conformed to the image of God.

Note of the two residencies of every believerour &lt;i&gt;real home &lt;/i&gt;is in Christ Jesus; in heavenly placesour &lt;i&gt;apartment&lt;/i&gt; is where we get our mail every day. One is &lt;i&gt;permanent&lt;/i&gt;, the other is &lt;i&gt;temporary&lt;/i&gt;. As we read in Ephesians 2, &lt;b&gt;we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus&lt;/b&gt;. But on earth, these saints were in Philippi. No one can read Pauls letters without seeing how often the phrases in Christ, in Christ Jesus, in the Lord occur. In Christ Jesus occurs 48 times, in Christ 34 times, and in the Lord 50 times. Clearly this was for Paul the very essence of Christianity. What did he mean? Marvin R. Vincent says that when Paul spoke of the Christian being in Christ, he meant that the Christian lives in Christ as a bird in the air, a fish in the water, the roots of a tree in the soil. We are in Christ and Christ is in us. He is our Lord and He is our life.

Paul mentions expressly the bishops and deacons of the congregation, not as a hierarchy separate from the congregation, but as a part of the congregation.

As early as the middle of the first century, therefore, the Christians recognized special ministers of the Word. The bishops were those members of the presbytery that were engaged in the ministry of the Word, in the capacity of preachers. The deacons were also members of the presbytery of the congregation, but were more properly engaged in the external business of the congregation, in the care of the poor, etc.

He mentions the church before the bishops and deacons, because the leadership are raised up by The Lord to edify, benefit and build up the church. &lt;b&gt;Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;2Co 1:24&lt;/b&gt;.

The primary purpose of the leadership of any church is to &lt;b&gt;feed the sheep of Jesus &lt;/b&gt;and to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;take good care of His bride while He is away.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Grace- &lt;/b&gt;grace is that holy influence upon our souls that convicts us and draws us to the saving knowledge of Christ. It is that divine gift from God that affords joy, pleasure, delight, sweetness, charm and loveliness of character. It is that grace of God that keeps, strengthens, increases them in Christian faith, knowledge, affection, and kindles them to the exercise of the Christian virtues.

&lt;b&gt;Peace- &lt;/b&gt;the tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and content with its earthly lot, of whatsoever sort that is.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Gods grace is unconditional and undeserved and is not &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; this world. Gods peace is &lt;i&gt;relational and inward, not &lt;/i&gt;of this world. A person will never experience the peace of God until they have experienced the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ. No peace without grace. There is no peace our works because you never know if you have done enough&lt;b&gt;the rest of God ceases from our own works. Heb 3,4.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The first thought which Paul voices is one of gratitude and thanksgiving toward God. Whenever he thinks of the congregation at Philippi, he finds cause for grateful prayer to God.

Paul is going to tell us the kind of things that we are set out minds upon in chapter 4. Paul could have thought of Philippi and thought of being beaten and jailed. He could have remembered the pest that the demon-possessed girl was. Instead, he remembered the saints and his fondness for them.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, Vs. 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The specific reason for his joy was their fellowship in the gospel from the first day until the present moment. These believers eagerly assisted Paul in evangelizing Philippi from the beginning of the church there &lt;b&gt;(Acts 16:1240).&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Please observe in verses 4 and 5 that &lt;i&gt;Paul isnt saying that he is praying for them to support him. He prays for them because they support him.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 He who began from the start in you a good work will carry it out to the end until the day of Christ Jesus.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The good work of which Paul is speaking is the work of regeneration. &lt;i&gt;This is a good work because God has wrought it, not because of any cooperation in man; it is God's work all alone. &lt;/i&gt;Paul Kretzma

Salvation is:

&lt;b&gt;A Work Of God&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:1; John 6:44&lt;/b&gt;. Salvation is a work begun by God in eternity past - &lt;b&gt;Eph. 1:4-6; Rev. 13:8; 17:8&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Work Of Grace&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:8-9&lt;/b&gt; - God does in us what we cannot do for ourselves. He comes to those who are helpless to come to Him - &lt;b&gt;Rom. 5:6-8&lt;/b&gt;. Salvation is a gift from God and is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Salvation is an ongoing work!&lt;/b&gt; Every single believers testimony is I was saved  I am being saved  I will be saved. The present phase of our salvation is the process of sanctification. And God's plan is to reproduce Jesus in each of us - &lt;b&gt;Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18&lt;/b&gt;. It Was Ruth Graham Bell I believe who had it mentioned at her memorial service these words. Construction is now complete, thank you for your patience!

Before we move on beloved, would you please observe here in verse 6 that we are not able in our own strength and power to remain faithful to the end, but it is God who began this work in us Who will be faithful to will complete it. This confirms the doctrine of eternal security. The only salvation that is spoken of in Scripture is the one that Jesus is the Author and Finisher of.

The work of salvation is a complete work. Nobody is able to pluck us out of the hand of our Heavenly Father or our Lord Jesus Christ. We are kept by the power of God unto salvation, Peter writes.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Heart- &lt;/b&gt;the heart as it is used here and in many other places in Scripture refers to the center of our thoughts and feelings, not the physical, blood pumping organ.

&lt;b&gt;Defense and confirmation&lt;/b&gt;- During his imprisonment, the Philippians sent Paul money and Epaphrodituss services to support the apostle, thus sharing in &lt;b&gt;the defence and confirmation of the gospel.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The affections (&lt;/b&gt;KJV, &lt;i&gt;bowels&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;). &lt;/b&gt;The Greek word for affections&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the strongest Greek word to express compassionate lovea love that involves ones entire being.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Thus, the mercies Paul has for this congregation is actually the overflow of the mercies and love that The Great Shepherd of the sheep, Christ Jesus has poured into him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; vs. 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; vs. 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
He prays that their love would abound more and more. This means that biblical love is something we need to work at constantly. Did you give any thought to it this past week? Husbands, are you working at loving your wife? Wives, are you working at loving your husband? Parents, are you working at loving your children? Children, are you working at respecting and loving your parents? Singles, are you working at loving your roommate? Saints are we actively working on loving one another in the flock here. Growing in love is a lifelong process.

Would you notice beloved that Biblical love is bound up with knowledge and discernment. There is a tendency to think of love as being undiscriminating. To the natural mind, discrimination and love seem like opposites. But Paul prays that the Philippians would grow in discerning love. Discerning love is not blind. It does not close its eyes to reality. It is not a feeling devoid of content. Biblical love is related to true knowledge and it operates with careful discernment.

To grow in the love and knowledge of God will cause us to be perceptive, and the objective is that we are able to distinguish between right and wrong. &lt;b&gt;Heb 5.12-14 &lt;/b&gt;

Again, we see the need for sound, biblical theology and a biblical worldview of life, because biblical discernment is the ability to understand, interpret, and apply truth skillfully. Discernment is a cognitive act. Therefore no one who spurns right doctrine or sound reason can be truly discerning.

Thus the I feel good about taking this job or leaving this company or venturing into this area of ministry is in actual contradiction to what Paul is talking about here. Beloved, I do not need to tell you that there are plenty of things that feel good that are not Gods will for any of us!!

The purpose of discerning prayer is that we might&lt;b&gt; approve &lt;/b&gt;what is &lt;b&gt;excellent&lt;/b&gt;. The NIV translates, &lt;i&gt;to discern what is best&lt;/i&gt;. Moffatt paraphrases, &lt;i&gt;Enabling you to have a sense of what is vital&lt;/i&gt;. In other words beloved, God does not want us to dissipate our energies and to waste our time by forgetting what is vital and giving ourselves to second and third rate issues.

What is vital is that you focus your life on loving God and others based on true knowledge and discernment. If that is at the center of your life, everything else will fall into its proper place.

&lt;b&gt;Sincere and without offense.&lt;/b&gt; The Greek word for &lt;b&gt;sincere&lt;/b&gt; has been traced by some to originally describe something that was tested by sunlight. Let me explain, in the ancient world, dishonest pottery dealers filled cracks in their inferior products with wax before glazing and painting them, making worthless pots difficult to distinguish from expensive ones. The only way to avoid being defrauded was to hold the pot to the sun, making the wax- filled cracks obvious. Dealers marked their fine pottery that could withstand sun testing as sine cera &lt;i&gt;without wax&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Without offense&lt;/b&gt; can be translated Blameless and it refers to relational integrity. Christians are to live lives of true integrity that do not cause others to sin. To be blameless means to walk without stumbling. Paul used the word blameless to describe his own conscience before God and men (&lt;b&gt;Acts 24:16&lt;/b&gt;). Since God looks on the heart, to be sincere and blameless means to live openly before God, judging sin on the thought level. It means that you dont live a double life, putting on a good front around the church folks, but living another way when youre alone or with your family.

Please note that &lt;i&gt;the purpose of bearing fruit is for the glory and praise of God beloved&lt;/i&gt;. The word fruit implies, this is a process, not something instantaneous. The word picture also implies that it is the life of Christ working in and through us that produces the fruit (&lt;b&gt;John 15:1-6&lt;/b&gt;).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Our lives are to shine that people may see our good works and glorify our Heavenly Father. God is truly glorified when His people abound in discerning love.
&lt;h3&gt;Practical application&lt;/h3&gt;
The mood today is that if you are critical of anyones doctrine or personal life, no matter how unbiblical it may be, you are not loving and you are arrogant to judge this person. Jesus words, &lt;b&gt;Judge not, lest you be judged (Matt. 7:1)&lt;/b&gt; are wrenched out of context and misapplied. If people would just keep reading, Jesus goes on to say, &lt;b&gt;Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine (Matt. 7:6).&lt;/b&gt; How can you deter- mine if someone is a dog or swine if you dont make discerning judgments? A few verses later He warns us to &lt;b&gt;beware of false prophets who come as wolves in sheeps clothing (Matt. 7:15&lt;/b&gt;). It takes a discerning sheep to see that this isnt a fellow-sheep whom we need to embrace, but a ravenous wolf we need to avoid! Thus biblical love cannot be divorced from the true knowledge of God and from the discernment between truth and error and right and wrong that comes from a careful knowledge of Scripture.

These believers, along with Paul, were true servants of God, and of one another. Servant = Slave, one devoted to another to the disregard of ones own interests. This is the mark of genuine Christianity, a willingness to put others ahead of self  &lt;b&gt;Phil. 2:4; Rom. 12:14; Rom. 14:19-22; Rom. 15:1&lt;/b&gt;) Salvation is only the beginning! &lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:10; James 2:18&lt;/b&gt;

Jesus Christ never saves anyone so that they can just add church attendance or church events to their list of weekly things to do. Nor does He save anyone so that they can live happier lives that are just as self-centered as they were before. Every believer is saved to serve God.

Genuine Christian servanthood and love will always manifests itself in action one toward another &lt;b&gt;1 John 3:18; James. 2:15-16&lt;/b&gt;. Love is a command and not an option &lt;b&gt;Matt. 22:39&lt;/b&gt;. Genuine love among brethren is a mark of true salvation  &lt;b&gt;1 John 4:7; 20. &lt;/b&gt;It will always be costly, it will rarely be convenient.

Paul, who knew that it was God who started the work and God who would finish it, prayed fervently for these people. He exhorted them and taught them to apply sound biblical principles. Beloved, a proper belief in the sovereignty of God will never lead a person or a congregation to stoic passivity, but rather to diligent and fervent labor.

Why do I need to pray? Why do we have prayer meetings throughout the week? Why are we having another Week of Prayer in September? If God already knows everything, and Hes going to accomplish His sovereign will anyway, whats the point of praying? It is because the prayers of the saints are a vital part of Gods method for accomplishing His sovereign will. And He uses prayer to change the heart of the one doing the praying, as well as to work in the hearts of others.

Paul and Philippi had a wonderfully close relationship because they shared some wonderful things. They prayed for one another faithfully. They served one another lovingly. They supported the work of Gods kingdom practically and financially. In other words, seeking first the Kingdom of God was not just another thing to juggle along with other things in life. They lived and invested their lives in the kingdom of God and every other thing revolved around that, not the other way around. They had a kingdom perspective of fellowship, a kingdom perspective of vocation; a kingdom perspective of marriage and family; a kingdom perspective of finances.

Those same characteristics they shared are just as needed today as they were then. I challenge every one of us to strive together to make this church even greater in the coming days than she has been in the past, or is right now.

Standing still in the knowledge and love of The Lord Jesus Christ is not an option for the born again follower of Jesus. We do not grow in the Christian life by looking in the rear view mirror.

Salvation IS the work of God, but what is the work of God?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is the work of God, that you believe on Him Whom He has sent. John 6.29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Join Pastor Ray Viola for a deep word on motives and the Sovereignty of God. Why do we serve Jesus? Is it for recognition or the fame of the Lord? The way we are noticed or unnoticed is a great indicator. God's refinement has a way of showing us our hearts, may all that is seen be for the glory of HIS great Name!&lt;/em&gt;

Our precious Lord Jesus Christ said: &lt;b&gt;If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospels shall save it (Mark 8:34, 35)&lt;/b&gt;

Now thats a way to get a following, isnt it? The way to find life is by dying to self and living for Jesus Christ. We will see this morning, Lord willing, that it is possible for someone to experience real life in Jesus while at the same time be living in not the most comfortable conditions or situations.

In our texts this week, we find Paul was in circumstances in which we could not fault him for being unhappy. He is incarcerated for his faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. By now he was over 60, and this life of persecution and imprisonment has been going on for around 30 years. Paul is at a time in life when a man looks forward to enjoying the fruits of his lifelong labors.

Many American pastors by this time are looking forward to a relaxed schedule, a little more golf. If youre as successful in ministry as Paul was, you could expect to live off your book sales and speak at a lot of conferences and retreats.

But where was Paul? Instead of being out on the links or speaking under the pines at a retreat center, he was in prison in Rome, awaiting a trial that could result in his execution. He was not in the strictest confinement, in a dungeon (as he later was). He was in his own rented quarters, and his friends were allowed to visit him (&lt;b&gt;Acts 28:30, 31&lt;/b&gt;). But he was chained to a Roman guard 24 hours of every day. Listen to his perspective beloved.it is realit is challenging.it is as Watchmen Nee wrote, the Normal Christian Life.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Furtherance:&lt;/b&gt; Pauls confidence in the sovereign hand of God upon his life allowed him to see his imprisonment as a strategic way to advance the kingdom of God because it was actually clearing the way for the gospel of Jesus Christ to penetrate the ranks of the Roman military.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/74142071"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Paul was bound, but the word of God was not bound.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound, 2Ti 2:9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Another way that the gospel was furthered by Pauls imprisonment was his prison epistles Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon and this letter to the Philippians were the fruit of this time in Pauls life. We are impacted today, nearly 2,000 years later!

Pauls plan and desire was to go to Rome and preach the gospel.I am certain that sitting in a prison cell was not the way he expected God to answer his prayers. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Submission to the will of God prevents the devil from getting hold of our thoughts and attitudes. Its amazing that Paul does not speak a word of complaint about his situation. Hes not asking, Why is this happening to me? Ive served God faithfully all these years! Ive always sought to do His will. Why this? He yields because he knows that God is The Potter and he is the clay.

Rosemary Gallatin once said in the Christian life, it is only hard when you kick against the goads.

A.V. Simpson writes: &lt;i&gt;Paul was disciplined in the sturdy conflict of adversity and suffering.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The word palace here is a reference to the Praetorian Guard, which was composed of the soldiers in the imperial regiments whose barracks were at Rome. They would be equivalent to our Navy Seals or Army Rangers. As the different soldiers took turns guarding Paul, they would hear the gospel.

Paul thus turns a distressing, abrasive, personal humiliation into an opportunity to share Christ and as a means of glorifying Christ and furthering His kingdom.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Please note here saints that whenever we exercise faith, it has the potential to embolden other saints to serve Jesus without fear. There is another thing that is contagious and that is fear and unbelief. How we need the same spirit of Joshua and Caleb instead of the unbelief of the 10 spies.

Although he acknowledges that he was in prison, not once does Paul call himself the prisoner of Rome; he was the &lt;b&gt;prisoner of Jesus Christ (Eph. 3:1; 4:1).&lt;/b&gt; The soldiers chained to his wrist were not nasty, Emperor worshipping, trained to kill individuals; they were lost souls for whom Christ died. They were the harvest field that God planted him in.

Whether they knew it or not, Paul was determined to preach the gospel to them. Whether they liked it not, Paul was going to preach the gospel to them. I mean, other than kill him, what else could they do to him?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 16 The one preach Christ of contention (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;selfish ambition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Those preaching from envy and strife were not heretics, as was the case in &lt;b&gt;Gal 1.6-10&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2 Cor 11.4, 13-15&lt;/b&gt;. These individuals were apparently Christian pastors in Rome whose doctrine was correct, but whose hearts and motives were wrong. They were jealous of Paul and selfishly ambitious to promote their own ministries. But, at least the message they preached was the true gospel. Paul would never rejoice at the preaching of false doctrine concerning something as crucial as the gospel.

&lt;b&gt;Envy&lt;/b&gt; says, I dont think much of you. &lt;b&gt;Strife&lt;/b&gt; stirs up that bad attitude and sows division and dissension amongst believers. Envy and strife are more dangerous to the spiritual health of any church than drugs and alcohol.

The Greek word for &lt;b&gt;contention, &lt;/b&gt;which can also be translated&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;selfish ambition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;was used of politicians who canvassed the multitudes to build a personal following. Oh precious flock of God, let us beware of falling into the Corinthian pit of I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, I am of Peter spirit. Jesus said Follow Mebeloved, I love you dearly and pray for you daily, but my exhortation to you is to follow Jesus. May Jesus increase and Ray Viola decrease.

Fortunately, others preached Christ with good motives. They thought well of Paul and of the gospel message and were dedicated to serving God faithfully, regardless of who got the credit as long as Jesus got the glory!

Lets take a few minutes to address the topic of motives in serving The Lord. What is motive? &lt;i&gt;The word motive refers to that something or someone which moves a person to take a course of action. It is that something or someone which drives them to do what they do&lt;/i&gt;.

Because God knows the thoughts and intents of the heart, Scripture is full of verses that admonish us to make sure that our motivation for doing what we do is right in His sight because we can fool one another, we can even try to fool ourselves, but we cannot fool The Living God. .
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 3.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. 14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The only acceptable motive for serving The Lord is agape love. As I mentioned last week, before Jesus commissioned Peter to feed His sheep, He first asked him the most important questionDo you love Me?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Paul said, &lt;b&gt;The love of Christ constrains me 2 Cor 5.14. 1 Cor 13 &lt;/b&gt;clearly reveals that a person, a church can have great faith, be very giving, extremely charismatic and even give their lives up as martyrs and still lack the motivation of love for Jesus Christ. In &lt;b&gt;Rev 2.1-5, &lt;/b&gt;we see the church at Ephesus doing many great things, but lacking the most important thing. The motive of love for Jesus Christ and love for others.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul rejoiced because he knew that God is bigger than frauds and charlatans and wrong motives. He rejoiced in the fact Jesus Christ was being proclaimed and nothing could stop the power of the gospel to seek and save those who were dead in trespasses and sins.

In the providence of God, and because of Gods great love for lost sinners, many have come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ that was proclaimed by a hypocrite who may have presented the gospel in what you and I may call a strange or unorthodox way.

I truly believe that God loves us so much that He heals, saves and delivers a sincere seeker &lt;i&gt;in spite of&lt;/i&gt; the wrong motives of the preacher or pastor. Like in &lt;b&gt;Luke 15, &lt;/b&gt;Paul rejoiced in the fact that people were hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ, being convicted by God The Holy Ghost and coming to know Jesus in a very real way.

It is The Holy Spirit that convicts a person and regenerates their souls when the gospel is preached, regardless of the motives of the instrument that is delivering the message. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Pauls circumstances were enough to make any man unhappy, and yet we find him abounding with joy (1:18). May be many of you are here this morning living in circumstances that you never thought would happen. What was his secret? How could Paul be filled with joy in these dismal circumstances? The answer is, he had put into practice the words of Jesus, that the way to find true life is to lose your life for the sake of Jesus and the gospel.
&lt;h3&gt;Closing comments&lt;/h3&gt;
Pauls theology caused him to recognize and rest in the providence of God. Some of you, like Paul, are in situations you never planned to be in. He planned to go to Rome, but not in chains! Maybe youre in a confining situation where you feel bound by chains. It may be a difficult marriage that you didnt plan on. Maybe youre chained to a house full of kids. It may be a family problem. It could be a boring or a difficult job or the lack of a job. It could be a personal problem over which you have no control--a health problem or a situation that youve been thrust into with no choice on your part.

What should you do? Like Paul, &lt;i&gt;interpret your chains as an opportunity to the greatness and majesty of Jesus Christ.&lt;/i&gt; Peter speaks of the fiery trials of our precious faith in &lt;b&gt;1 Pet 1.7. &lt;/b&gt;After all of the unjust and cruel things that happened to him, I think of Josephs perspective regarding his fiery trial.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gen 50.20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. &lt;/b&gt;This is the OT version of &lt;b&gt;Romans 8.28&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And we know that &lt;i&gt;all things&lt;/i&gt; work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel is not, If youre having some problems in your life, invite Jesus into your heart and He will help you work out your problems. Nor is the gospel, If youd like a happier life, try Jesus. Those are unbiblical concepts that trivialize our most desperate need.

We are all sinners by nature and by choice. Sin is rebellion against a holy God. Sin separates man from God. For the debt of our sin to be forgiven, an innocent, sinless sacrifice is necessary. Until that sin is paid for, a person is living under the wrath of Almighty God (&lt;b&gt;John 3.36&lt;/b&gt;), and if he or she dies in this condition, he will spend eternity in hell, under the just condemnation of God.

The bad news is that none of us can do a single thing to change our condition before God. All of the good deeds cannot take away our sin. All of my religion and ritual cannot take away our sin. The solution? &lt;b&gt;God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Rom. 5:8).&lt;/b&gt;

Jesus Christ, the sinless, Only Begotten Son of God, met the requirement of Gods Law in His perfect obedience to the Father. He went to the cross as the Lamb of God, to take away the sin of the world (&lt;b&gt;John 1:29&lt;/b&gt;). On the thirdday, Jesus bodily arose from the dead, victorious over sin, death, and hell.

God offers to every person a full pardon from sin and total reconciliation to Himself based on what Jesus Christ did on the cross. The only way to receive this full pardon of sin and divine deliverance from Gods judgment is to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:31; Eph. 2:8, 9&lt;/b&gt;).

The gospel is not a guarantee of a pain-free, problem-free life. The gospel is not a promise of perfect health and abundant wealth. The gospel is the promise of forgiveness of sin. The gospel is the promise of deliverance from the power of darkness. The gospel is the promise that no matter what adversities or sorrows you experience in this life, Jesus will never leave you nor forsake you. The gospel is the promise of life everlasting in heaven with Jesus Christ.

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 29:11-12 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These words are some of the most beautiful expressions in all of Scripture of the heart of our Heavenly Father towards us. They are both encouraging and challenging.

They are encouraging in the sense that He invites us to call upon Him. They are challenging in that He tells us to do so with all of our hearts. His promise to those who seek Him wholeheartedly is that He will answer us and show us great and mighty things that we know not. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Talk about incentive! These are not my words beloved, these are the words of The Living God. You and I as followers of Jesus Christ the privilege of talking to The Everlasting God Who spoke the entire universe into existence!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus said,&lt;b&gt; Isa 56.7 My house shall be called a house of prayer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus left us an example to follow and He truly practiced what He preached.Listen to what is written about the prayer life of The Son of God, The Word who is God made flesh.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 5:7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 9:28 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. 29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 6:12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
He prayed in at His baptism, He prayed all night before He chose the apostles, He prayed in The Garden, He prayed on the cross. Right now He ever lives to make intercession for us! Following Jesus means following His example of communion with The Father and dependency upon The Father.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

What is one of the reason why God call us to pray unto Him? Because prayer is a means of communication and our God is a Jealous God Who loves us more than we will ever know. The purpose of prayer is to develop intimacy with God.

&lt;!--more--&gt;This glorious example of Jesus and these precious verses in Jeremiah are the foundation for what we are doing here this week - we are setting aside this week to pray and to seek The Lord...seeking &lt;i&gt;His &lt;/i&gt;wisdom...seeking &lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; direction....seeking &lt;i&gt;His &lt;/i&gt;healing touch....seeking &lt;i&gt;His &lt;/i&gt;sanctification in our lives...seeking &lt;i&gt;His&lt;/i&gt; vision for victory and provision for every area of ministry.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pr 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We see in &lt;b&gt;Acts 13.1-3 &lt;/b&gt;that the plans of God were given to the church during a time of praying and fasting.
&lt;h3&gt;The scope of our prayer&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
We are seeking Him for reconciliation of broken relationships. We are seeking Him for a fresh sense of His presence and majesty. We are seeking Him for a return to our first love in all that we do. We are seeking Him for that precious unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

We will be seeking Him for all outreach ministries and a fresh vision and heart to reach the lost...praying for marriages....praying for our singles, single parents, prodigals.....teens, elderly. We will be seeking Him for His grace and blessing upon other portions of His body here and around the world.

We will be praying for our nation's political leaders.we will be praying for our local and state political leaders.

Beloved, at this very moment your circumstances may be against you....your feelings may be against you....your health may be against you; but if you are an adopted child of The Living God, &lt;i&gt;He is not against you&lt;/i&gt;; in fact, not only is Jesus our Great High Priest interceding for you, we are also told that &lt;b&gt;nothing can separate you from His love &lt;/b&gt;and according to His promise in &lt;b&gt;Romans 8.28,&lt;/b&gt; He is working those very things that you and I are wrestling with today for your ultimate good and His glory!!

Beloved, never forget that in spite of what the changes and challenges of life throws at us, our heavenly Father has precious thoughts towards us.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When we begin to realize the love of The Father towards us as His children, we can then being to understand more clearly why Jesus taught us to pray, &lt;b&gt;not my will, but Thy will be done&lt;/b&gt;. That is because the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; will for your life is Gods will; the &lt;i&gt;worst &lt;/i&gt;will for your life is your will.

The purpose of prayer is not to persuade God to do what we want, but to align our hearts to His good and perfect will.

This week of prayer provides for us a time for our church family to come together and humble our hearts before Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Pe 5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 51.17 The sacrifices of God &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a broken spirit: A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

The Spirit of God will not move in a self-righteous, self centered, self-sufficient person or church.

I truly believe that a fresh outpouring of The Spirit of God takes place whenever the people of God empty themselves and determine to gather together before The Father with no agenda other than His. God promises to bless those who humble themselves before Him in unity.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 133:1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt;A Song of degrees of David.&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The same word that is used here for&lt;b&gt; pleasant, &lt;/b&gt;is used also in the Hebrew for a harmony of music. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Division and discord grieves the Spirit of God and breaks The Father's heart. There are some of you that are carrying grudges and resentment in your hearts towards others in the body here and elsewhere in the body of Christ. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

You can either deal with that destructive matter of the heart Gods way or your way. Gods way will give you peace, your way will kill you. &lt;i&gt;Never shall we know the full power of the anointing till we are of one heart and of one spirit; never will the sacred dew of the Spirit descend in all its fulness till we are perfectly joined together in the same mind. &lt;/i&gt;Charles Spurgeon&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Listen to how The Holy Spirit describes move of God amongst a humbled, united body of believers
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ac 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were &lt;i&gt;assembled together&lt;/i&gt;; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness. 32 The multitude of them that believed were of &lt;i&gt;one heart&lt;/i&gt; and of &lt;i&gt;one soul&lt;/i&gt;. Ac 4:32.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Is there a correlation between Israel being in Babylon and the body of Christ today? I believe so.

These verses in Jeremiah declare The Fathers desire towards us &lt;b&gt;are for good and not for evil, to gives us a future and a hope. &lt;/b&gt;This was a promise given to Israel when they were in Babylonian captivity &lt;i&gt;because &lt;/i&gt;of sin and idolatry in their lives.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;They were a reminder of Gods desires towards them, and were given to them to urge them to forsake their idols and worldly agendas and return wholeheartedly to Him, The Fountain of Living Water.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;

Much of the church today is living in Babylon. We may not be worshipping Baal or Ashtoreth, but many church people are more concerned and preoccupied with bodily exercise and health food and their investments or the state of their house than the state of their eternal souls and the urgency of getting the gospel out to the lost. And Pastor Ray is as guilty as anyone else.

I am fully convinced that the number one enemy of wholehearted devotion to Christ is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the world, its &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;the devil...its not my children, my spouse, my job or the absence of one...its a lack of desire in my divided heart. King David had to deal with the danger of having a divided heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psa 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2 things the Psalmist asks The Lord to do in His life.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Teach me Your ways&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unite my heart to fear Your Name. I.E. Bring all of my affections and desires into full harmony with Your will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
You and I need to deal with the danger of having a divided heart. Let me repeat, &lt;i&gt;the number one enemy of whole hearted devotion to Christ is a divided heart....divided affections. &lt;/i&gt;How did Jesus describe the thorny heart in the parable of the sower?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark 4.18,19 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Once again, the thorny heart from Luke's perspective.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Beloved, according to Jesus, if our lives are cluttered with the cares of the world, deceitfulness of riches, lusts of other things, riches and pleasures of this life, we will not be fruitful. Do you want to be a fruitless Christian? Neglect making an investment of time developing a Christ centered marriage and raising children in the nurture and admonition of The Lord. Neglect daily times of prayer and reading of Gods Word. Make it the church's responsibility for you to have personal, deliberate efforts for fellowship with other saints during the week in your house. Ignore the warning of Hebrews 10.25 and forsake the regular times of gathering together for corporate worship, teaching and prayer.

That is one reason why we are told in verse 13, that we are to &lt;b&gt;seek Him and search for Him with all of our heart&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psa 119:2 Blessed &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they that keep his testimonies, &lt;i&gt;and that&lt;/i&gt; seek him with the whole heart.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 10:27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
My prayer for you individually and for us congregationally is that we would do &lt;i&gt;nothing &lt;/i&gt;half-heartedly. The Lord Jesus has died for us and He is The One Who is calling us to serve Him, worship Him and draw near to Him with &lt;b&gt;all of our heart, soul, mind and strength. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2Ch 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; whose heart &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; perfect (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;full, complete&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) toward him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If I/we are to seek The Lord with all of our hearts, then it means that I must be willing to set aside my plans and purposes in order to submit my life to The Lord and the plans that He has for me.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 4.16 Come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Beloved when we come to this throne of grace, we meet with our merciful and faithful High Priest, The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 2:18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Th 5:17 Pray without ceasing&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Col 4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Through the righteousness and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we come boldly, yet reverently before the throne of grace where we find mercy (&lt;i&gt;not getting what we deserve&lt;/i&gt;) and help in time of need.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prov 3.6&lt;/b&gt;In all they ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Seeking The Lord allows me to commit my life to The Lord afresh every single day and then stand back and watch Him direct my steps, to open and close doors. Prayer allows me to peek into the invisible hand of God working in my everyday life.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ps 37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. 5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
True prayer is not directing God; it is getting direction from The Lord. As we seek The Lord together this week, we are not seeking Him to give Him our plans and ask Him to bless them, we are laying down our plans and our will and asking Him to direct us. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It has been said that prayer can do what God can do. &lt;/i&gt;Note this promise of God:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Hebrew, "&lt;i&gt;inaccessible things&lt;/i&gt;," that is, incredible, hard for man's understanding to grasp.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eph 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
There is strength, power, forgiveness, grace, mercy, provision and love &lt;i&gt;beyond human understanding&lt;/i&gt; available to us that come to The Lord through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ.

I challenge you as never before in the history of this congregation to mark this week of prayer on your calendar. For some of you, the 6AM time of prayer may be the best. For some of you, coming during the day to pray may be the best. You can come during your lunch hour to pray. Every evening we will have prayer starting at 7PM, and thus Friday we will have prayer from 7PM Friday to 7PM Saturday. The church building will be open all day during office hours.

If you are unable to be here at the church building for prayer for one reason or another, I urge you to invite people over to your home and pray.pray with your familiespray during your lunch hours.

Gods promises are Gods provision. What could be more thrilling than spending time alone with God or with the family of God before the throne of grace?</ns3:encoded>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;In our study this week we are made aware that self-centeredness was a problem that existed in the congregation in Philippi (see also Phil 4.2,3). The Holy Spirit mentions words like strife and vainglory to describe the attitudes that existed within this local church (Phil 2.3). The word strife speaks of selfish ambition and vainglory speaks of serving Jesus with the wrong motive of self-exaltation. How important it is for us to understand that strife and vainglory are enemies of unity in The Spirit (Eph 4.1-3). The devil may be a liar, but even he knows that there is a particular blessing that God pours out upon brethren who dwell together in unity (Psalm 133; 1 Cor 12.12-27).&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;According to Paul, the key to unity is really two-fold. One, it is remembering the reality of the work of God in our lives (Phil 2.1). And two, it is remembering the example of self-emptying humility of our Lord Jesus Christ (Phil 2.5-10).&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;John 17.16-23&lt;/b&gt;, The Lord Jesus prayed &lt;b&gt;they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
We are no longer citizens of this fallen world system that is built on me, myself and I (cp. &lt;b&gt;Phil 1.22,27&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

All who come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ are one body. There is only one body of Christ on Planet Earth today.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

He prayed that we would mature in our relationship with Him and the Father, in order &lt;b&gt;that the world may believe that The Father sent Him (vs. 21, 27).&lt;/b&gt;

So, the recognition of who we are in Christ is the basis of our unity and is an integral part of winning the lost to The Lord Jesus Christ. According to &lt;b&gt;Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4, &lt;/b&gt;the recognition of who we are in Christ is the motivation for service and the basis of genuine care and compassion for one another in the body of Christ.

So the gospel of Jesus Christ is a message that glorifies The Father, exalts Jesus Christ, and gives birth to a Spirit driven body of believers who are passionate about reaching the lost and ministering to one another for the glory of God. Can I get an Amen?

As I bring forth this message, the only congregation that I am thinking about is ours.

Now, after we read these 11 verses from Philippians 2 and The Holy Spirit allows to take a look into the hearts of this congregation, (&lt;i&gt;how many of you know that The Holy Spirit is looking at what is going on in your hearts this morning&lt;/i&gt;?). Do you see what is going on here at Phillipi beloved? This is anything &lt;i&gt;but &lt;/i&gt;a display of Jesus in John 17. There is anything but unity and oneness.

This congregation has a real problem with motives, attitudes and unity. At the end of chapter one (no chapter divisions in Scripture) Paul tells these precious saints that they are to &lt;b&gt;stand fast with one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel. &lt;/b&gt;Instead of standing fast and striving together for the faith of the gospel, they were striving and competing with one another (cp. &lt;b&gt;Phil 4.1-3&lt;/b&gt;).

I believe that we can safely conclude that this congregation had completely lost sight of 2 major things.
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Their primary purpose here on earth, which is to reach the lost and make disciples of Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who the real enemy is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Instead of coming together for prayer and working together to reach the lost and minister to one another in the love of God, they are competing with one another and driven by pride and selfishness.

One of the greatest dangers to real evangelism and gospel based unity within any local congregation is selfish ambition, vain-glory and the old every man or woman for themselves! mentality.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/75790625"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

How destructive it is when the self centered mentality of the fallen world system creeps into the bloodstream of the body of Christ. If there is an anti-gospel message it is one that is man centered and that only focuses on myself and getting my needs met, as opposed to a message that is Christ centered and looks for ways to bless others for the glory of God.

How sad it is when the redeemed of The Lord have a whats in it for me mentality instead of a what would Jesus do and what did He teach mentality.

Since you and I are prone to being driven by vainglory, selfish ambition and pride, may The Spirit of God give us ears to hear this much needed exhortation.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.1 If there be therefore any consolation (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;encouragement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;affections&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) and mercies,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What Paul is saying here is this. Havent you been encouraged by Jesus Christ? Havent you experienced His comfort? Havent you tasted the sweet fellowship of The Spirit of God? Hasnt God bestowed His affection and mercy towards you? &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Of course the answer to all of these questions is yes. Since all of that is true, pass it on to one another.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.2 Fulfil (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) ye my joy that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul reveals a great pastors heart. One of the most wonderful joys in ministry is when the flock flows together in the love of God and power of The Holy Spirit.

What a wonderful thing to pray beloved. Father, cause all of us to be likeminded, filled with the love of Christ, of one accord and one mind.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 15.6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Peter 3.8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

What happens when the body is of one accord and one mind? According to &lt;b&gt;Psalm 133&lt;/b&gt;, that is where God commands His blessing. According to &lt;b&gt;Acts 1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, what happened when the body gathered together in the upper room of prayer? The Spirit of God was poured out.

When a person or a congregation is flowing in the unity of The Spirit, the overflow of that kind of fellowship with The Lord are spiritual blessings and a bonding of relationships in Christ.

&lt;b&gt;3 enemies of unity. Strife, vainglory and pride. &lt;/b&gt;These 3 fleshly lusts are anti-gospel, anti-Christ attitudes. There is nothing good that results from strife, vainglory and pride.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;rivalry, selfish ambition or conceit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;); but in lowliness of mind (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;humility&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) let each esteem (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;count&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) other better (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;more important&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) than themselves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 13.13 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Galatians 5.20 &lt;/b&gt;tells us that &lt;b&gt;strife &lt;/b&gt;is a work of the flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Strife &lt;/b&gt;is selfish ambition&lt;b&gt; and vainglory &lt;/b&gt;is empty pride. The purpose of any local congregation or ministry is to advance the cause of Christ, not to advance us. Again, what The Holy Spirit confronts us with is the subject of motives of the heart. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Ministry in the local church and in the body of Christ at large should never be a matter of competition, but one of seeking to compliment one another for the glory of God. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Esteem others better than myself. &lt;/b&gt;A cross-based humility is the antidote for proud or haughty attitudes within the body of Christ. A proper understanding of who we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; are in the shadow of the cross will always produce Christ like humility instead of Lucifer like pride and self-exaltation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Beloved, the aim of the Christian life and ministry within the local church ought &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to be self-display or self-exaltation, but self-denial and Christ exalting.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

I can tell you right now that our natural, carnal mind is not wired to deny self and exalt Christ. It is not wired to esteem others better than us. Apart from the cross and the submitting to the power of The Holy Spirit within us, we will compete, we will compare, and we will scratch and claw to further our own opinions, our own agenda and purposes. And we will eliminate any competition that gets in our way.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.4 Look not every man on his own things (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;interests&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), but every man also on the things (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;interests&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) of others.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Greek word for &lt;b&gt;look &lt;/b&gt;here carries the idea of&lt;i&gt; fixing the attention upon with a desire for and interest in. &lt;/i&gt;Beloved, you and I know that the vast majority of our Christian life is spent outside of the church building. Thus, a very important element of living for Christ and growing in Christ is experienced outside of these walls as we reach out to meet one anothers needs, as we are made aware of them.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Corinthians 10.24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Corinthians 13.5 &lt;/b&gt;tells us that one of the characteristics of Gods love working in our lives and church family is that it &lt;b&gt;seeketh not her own&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

Let me ask you this question. Did any of you pray this morning or on the way to church that God would give you eyes to see and ears to hear any needs that my brothers and sisters may have? &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

William Barclay with great insight writes this: &lt;i&gt;If a man is forever concerned first and foremost with his own interests, he is bound to collide with others. If for him life is a competition whose prizes he must win, he will always think of other human beings as enemies or at least as opponents who must be pushed out of the way. Concentration on self inevitably means elimination of others; and the object of life becomes not to help others up but to push them down.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.5 Let this mind (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;attitude&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) be in you (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;among yourselves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), which was also in Christ Jesus:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;did not consider&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) to be equal with God (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus did not use His deity for His own advantage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This is one of the most difficult passages in the Bible, prompting various (Gk) kenosis (lit emptying) theories attempting to describe what Jesus gave up in coming to earth.

Although the text clearly reveals the deity and humanity of The Lord Jesus Christ, its specific purpose is meant to illustrate he example of Christian humility.

The Greek word for &lt;b&gt;form &lt;/b&gt;here refers to that which is intrinsic and essential to the being of God.

So when Paul states that Jesus existed in the form of God (1:6), he is referring to His preexistence before He was born of the Virgin Mary. Jesus is not a created being, but rather is the second person of the triune God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.7 But made himself of no reputation (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;He emptied Himself&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), and took upon him the form of a servant (&lt;/b&gt;Gr. &lt;i&gt;slave&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), and was made in the likeness of men:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Jesus came as a Man, He was still divine. Then of what did He empty Himself? He emptied Himself of His divine powers. He did not cease to be God, but He did lay aside His glory and the independent use of His attributes as God. His life as the God-Man on earth was completely subjected to the Father.

The implications of the doctrine of kenosis are huge for you and me, because this means that everything Jesus didthe miracles He ministered, the prayers He prayed, the teachings He gavewere not done in His own power. Jesus healed and prayed and taught through the power of the Holy Spirit as He followed the Fathers directives.

Remember that Jesus said, &lt;b&gt;as The Father sent Me, so send I you. &lt;/b&gt;

Even though Jesus was God incarnate, while here on earth, He did not demand or cling to His rights as God, but laid that aside and in its place took the form of a slave.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

It is interesting to me that the 2 times in Scripture where Jesus is &lt;i&gt;specifically &lt;/i&gt;mentioned as leaving us an example to follow are found in&lt;b&gt; John 13, &lt;/b&gt;and that pertains to being a servant or slave and in&lt;b&gt; 1 Peter 2, &lt;/b&gt;which pertains to suffering in doing the will of God.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 20.26-28 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; 27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: 28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 13.14 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

As glorious and precious as the doctrine of the atonement of Christ is, we fall short of the entire message of the cross if we limit it exclusively to the time of His brutal beating and sacrifice. The Holy Spirit through Paul uses the &lt;i&gt;kenosis &lt;/i&gt;or emptying of Jesus Christ as an example of humility that is to be adopted as a lifestyle by all followers of Jesus Christ.

Let me repeat that Paul is not using our text to combat some heresy or theological error. He is writing about a most practical subject--how Christians can get along with one another. It applies to how we relate to one another in the church, but also in our homes. You see beloved, at the heart of every one of our relational problems no matter how we cut the pie is self. To live in harmony, we must learn to die to self and humbly live for others for Jesus sake.

Any personal cost we have to bear in serving Christ is nothing by way of comparison to what Jesus did for us, even if it means laying down our lives. As Isaac Watts put it, &lt;i&gt;Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.8 And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus humility came through becoming obedient. Servants or slaves obey; Jesus obeyed God, even to the point of dying on a cross.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;It would have been amazing enough for the eternal God to come to this earth as a mighty king. It was even more amazing that He came as a humble servant. But its almost beyond comprehension that He would even go lower and die. And, even more staggering, His death was not a noble death, but a horrible, ignoble death of a common criminal. For the Jew, whoever was hanged on a tree was accursed of God&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Deut. 21:23&lt;/b&gt;). Pastor Steven Cole
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
On a doctrinal note, &lt;b&gt;Isa 45.23&lt;/b&gt; refers to the final submission of all nations to God; that Paul applies the text to Jesus (especially with an Old Testament divine title, Lord, in v. 11) is telling. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Christs experience proves that exaltation always follows humiliation. &lt;b&gt;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,&lt;/b&gt; promises &lt;b&gt;1 Peter 5:6&lt;/b&gt;. The person who &lt;b&gt;exalts himself will be humbled (Luke 14:11)&lt;/b&gt;. Remember what happened to Pharaoh, King Saul, Nebuchadnezzar, Haman, and Herod?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Paul is saying here that to proclaim Him as Lord and deny Him in practice in contrary to the message of the cross and authentic Christianity.

In closing, it has been said that the one thing that prevents a person from walking in humility is pride and self-righteousness.

C.S Lewis wrote &lt;i&gt;pride has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began.... Pride always means enmity--it &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;enmity. And not only enmity between man and man, but also enmity to God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;In God you come up against something that is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself. Unless you know God as that--and, therefore, know yourself as nothing in comparison--you do not know God at all. As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you&lt;/i&gt; (Mere Christianity [Macmillan], pp. 110-111).

Pride will never completely go away this side of heaven beloved. A Spanish bullfighter made a tragic mistake. He thrust his sword a final time into the bull, which then collapsed. Thinking that the bull was dead, the bullfighter turned to the crowd to acknowledge the applause. But the bull was not dead. It rose and lunged at the back of the unsuspecting matador, piercing his heart with its horn. Pride is like that. Just when we think weve conquered it and we turn to accept the congratulations of the crowd, pride stabs us in the back. It wont be dead before we are.

Have you received Christ Jesus The Lord t as Savior and Master of your life?

Hopefully, we have learned in these scriptures is that being a Christian is far more than accepting Christ in order to receive forgiveness of sin and be assured that I will go to heaven when I die (&lt;i&gt;which is all true&lt;/i&gt;).

Being a Christian means that I have made the decision to follow Jesus Christ as Lord of my life. As Pastor Ben reminded us last week, being a Christian means that &lt;b&gt;for me to live is Christ and to die is gain. &lt;/b&gt;Call upon His Name today.embrace the full meaning of the cross and begin to experience what Jesus called &lt;b&gt;life, and that more abundantly (John 10.10). &lt;/b&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
David Guzik from &lt;a href="https://www.enduringword.com/"&gt;Enduring Word Media&lt;/a&gt; writes:

In August of 1513, a monk lectured on the book of Psalms in a seminary, but his inner life was nothing but turmoil. In his studies, he came across &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Psa&amp;amp;c=31&amp;amp;v=1#s=509001"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 31:1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: In Thy righteousness deliver me.&lt;/b&gt; The passage confused him; how could God's &lt;i&gt;righteousness&lt;/i&gt; do anything but condemn him to Hell as a righteous punishment for his sins? Martin Luther kept thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rom&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;v=17#s=1047017"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 1:17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which says that in the gospel&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, "the just shall live by faith" (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Hab&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=4#s=905004"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt; The monk went on to say: "&lt;i&gt;Night and day I pondered until  I grasped the truth that the righteousness of God is that righteousness whereby, through grace and sheer mercy, he justifies us by faith. Therefore I felt myself to be reborn and to have gone through open doors into paradise  This passage of Paul became to me a gateway into heaven."&lt;/i&gt; Martin Luther was born again, and the reformation began in his heart.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Before we look at these verses in detail, we need to see the flow of Pauls reasoning. He begins verse 16 with the word &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt;, which connects it with verse 15. There Paul said, &lt;b&gt;I am ready&lt;/b&gt; (or eager) &lt;b&gt;to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome&lt;/b&gt;. Why? &lt;b&gt;For I am not ashamed of the gospel&lt;/b&gt;.... Why? &lt;b&gt;For it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.&lt;/b&gt; How is this gospel the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes? &lt;b&gt;For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith&lt;/b&gt;. Is this a new idea that Paul thought up? No, he cites &lt;b&gt;Habakkuk 2:4&lt;/b&gt;, as it is written, &lt;b&gt;But the just shall live by faith&lt;/b&gt;.

In these passages, we sense Pauls urgency and determination to press on in the proclamation of the gospel. He would say to the elders of Ephesus, &lt;b&gt;but none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of The Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (Acts 20.24). &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom. 1:16 I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Paul says that he is not ashamed of the gospel, he is saying that he is not ashamed of the message of the gospel, nor is he ashamed of The Lord of the gospel. He is not concerned if it sounds politically correct or if it is popular.

To say that he is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ is quite a statement. Rome is the capital of the then known world. It was the center of the whos who in nearly every arena of life. It was a highly sophisticated and educated city. It was a very spiritually liberal city.

But God is not impressed in the least by mans intelligence or athletic skills or massive amounts of wealth. Remember beloved, lest you and I are prone to be a bit proud, God owns the entire universe and every single thing in it!&lt;!--more--&gt;

You see, a persons intelligence of lack of it will not save them. A persons ability to throw a football 500 yards or hit a baseball 600 feet will not save them. A persons wealth will not save them. Thus, the only message that can save a persons soul from their debt of sin and alienation from God and give unto them a new heart forever is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and Paul was not ashamed to proclaim it, despite the consequences.

Think about it beloved. Paul had been imprisoned in Philippi (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:2324&lt;/b&gt;), chased out of Thessalonica (&lt;b&gt;Acts 17:10&lt;/b&gt;), smuggled out of Berea (&lt;b&gt;Acts 17:14&lt;/b&gt;), laughed at in Athens (&lt;b&gt;Acts 17:32&lt;/b&gt;), regarded as a fool in Corinth (&lt;b&gt;1 Cor. 1:1823&lt;/b&gt;), and stoned in Galatia (&lt;b&gt;Acts 14:19&lt;/b&gt;). But none of those things moved Paul. He was determined to preach the gospel in Rome in spite of the fact that it was the seat of contemporary political power, athletic skills, academic superiority, wealth, military power and pagan religion. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

None of these things that the Romans prided themselves in could curb Pauls boldness to unashamedly proclaim the gospel. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

James MacDonald writes: &lt;i&gt;Shame is the opposite of honor. Shame includes feelings of embarrassment and humiliation. When we are ashamed of Christ, we cower, we retreat, we back down. For the followers of Jesus Christ, retreat is not an option. Listen to these sobering words of The Master Himself.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For whosoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels. (Mark 8.38)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For it is the power of God unto salvation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
To proclaim the gospel boldly or unashamedly, first we must believe it. But to believe it, we must understand it. The gospel is all about salvation. Salvation is the main need of every person. Because all have sinned, whether they are a religious Jew or the worldly Greek, all are alienated from God by nature and by choice, and are all are under Gods wrath.

&lt;b&gt;Power. &lt;/b&gt;The English word dynamite comes from this Greek word &lt;i&gt;dunamis&lt;/i&gt;. Although the message may sound foolish to some (&lt;b&gt;1 Cor. 1:18&lt;/b&gt;), the gospel is effective because it carries with it the omnipotence of God.

Only Gods power is able to overcome mans sinful nature and give him new life (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 5:6 8:3; John 1:12; 1 Cor. 1:18 2325 2:14 4:20; 1 Pet. 1:23&lt;/b&gt;). And if there was ever a city that needed the gospel, it was Rome. The ancient philosopher Seneca called Rome "&lt;i&gt;a cesspool of iniquity&lt;/i&gt;" and the ancient writer Juvenal called it a "&lt;i&gt;filthy sewer into which the dregs of the empire flood." &lt;/i&gt;For God so loved the city and citizens of Rome.finish the passage from &lt;b&gt;John 3.16,17&lt;/b&gt;.

Paul is not ashamed of the gospel because he knows that the gospel of Jesus Christ has &lt;i&gt;inherent&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;power&lt;/b&gt;. The church does not &lt;i&gt;give&lt;/i&gt; the gospel power and no one denomination in the church can claim exclusive ownership of the gospel. It is the ascended Lord Jesus Christ Who gives unto the church the authority to preach the gospel.

In a world of bad news, the gospel is the only &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;news&lt;/i&gt;, but it is more than information; it is the power of God unto salvation. "&lt;i&gt;The gospel is not good advice to nice people, who need a little help getting right with The Almighty Holy God and Lord of heaven and earth. It is the very power of God that is needed to save self righteous, unholy, ungodly, enemies of God who despise His moral authority and are rebels by nature and by choice in His universe.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Salvation.&lt;/b&gt; This Greek word that is translated salvation here basically means &lt;i&gt;deliverance&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;rescue&lt;/i&gt;.

Thus salvation means being delivered from the penalty of sin, which happens the moment we believe (&lt;b&gt;Eph 1.13,14&lt;/b&gt;).

It also means that we are being delivered from the power of sin, as we put on Christ grow in grace and in the knowledge of Him (&lt;b&gt;Eph 4.24; Col 3.10; 2 Pet 3.18&lt;/b&gt;).

It ultimately means that we will be delivered from the very presence of sin when we stand blameless in His presence in glory (&lt;b&gt;Jude 24&lt;/b&gt;).

Biblical salvation is not simply a one- time event that has absolutely no impact on the way that you live, but it is an ongoing condition of abiding and growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

And it is given &lt;b&gt;to everyone who believes.&lt;/b&gt; The Greek word for believes here means &lt;i&gt;to trust in, cling to, rely on, or have faith in&lt;/i&gt;. True saving faith is &lt;b&gt;a gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:8&lt;/b&gt;)

The only limitation to the saving power of the gospel is &lt;b&gt;whosoever believeth. &lt;/b&gt;While the atonement of Jesus Christ is unlimited in its power and scope, it is only applied to whosoever believes in Him unto eternal life.

This gospel is not limited to one race or ethnic group of people; it is the power of God unto &lt;b&gt;the Jew first&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;and then to the Greek.&lt;/b&gt; The redeemed in glory are said to be out of &lt;b&gt;every kindred and tongue and people and nation (Rev 5.9)&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Rom. 1:17 for therein (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the gospel of Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;)is righteousness of God revealed&lt;/b&gt;. Better translated, &lt;i&gt;righteousness from God&lt;/i&gt;. Only God is inherently righteous, and man falls woefully short of the divine standard of moral perfection (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 3:10 23&lt;/b&gt;). But the gospel reveals that on the basis of faithand faith aloneGod will impute his righteousness to ungodly sinners.

The righteousness of God revealed in the gospel is that He grants to the believing sinner a right standing before Him because His Son Jesus Christ has met the righteous requirement of His perfect Law and died on the cross to pay the penalty that Gods holiness demands and absorb the wrath that all sinners deserve.

Thus redeemed sinners are not justified or made righteous by their own good works or by keeping the Law (&lt;b&gt;Gal. 3:11&lt;/b&gt;), but rather by God imputing the righteousness of Christ to them by faith. Paul states this plainly in &lt;b&gt;Philippians 3&lt;/b&gt;, where he contrasts his former attempts to be righteous by keeping the Law with his present experience with Christ, where he says (&lt;b&gt;Phil. 3:9&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;b&gt;not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.&lt;/b&gt;

In other words, by the grace of God, all of my sin, all of my wrath and all of my guilt was placed upon Jesus Christ on the cross. By Gods grace, through faith in Him, I have imputed or reckoned unto me all of Christs righteousness, all of His grace and all of His mercy. And it is all of grace from&lt;b&gt; faith for faith.&lt;/b&gt; The righteousness from God is completely on the basis of grace through faith from beginning to end. &lt;b&gt;As it is written in Hab. 2:4. The just shall live by faith. &lt;/b&gt;

"&lt;i&gt;He saith not, from faith to works, or from works to faith; but from &lt;b&gt;faith to faith&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; i.e. &lt;i&gt;only by faith&lt;/i&gt;." (Poole)&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

This phrase from &lt;b&gt;faith to faith &lt;/b&gt;underlines that true faith is not a single event, but a transformed way of life by the power of Gods Spirit by which a person, like a newborn baby, begins to progressively and purposefully walk after the things of The Lord and in newness of life.

A challenge to KF..&lt;b&gt;2 Tim 1.8 &lt;/b&gt;tells us&lt;b&gt; not to be ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord. &lt;/b&gt;

The idea is a courtroom setting and it your turn to take the witness stands. People are watching and listening. Will you speak unapologetically about Jesus Christ and His gospel no matter whom it is you are talking to or where you are? Will you speak to please men or God?

Remember beloved, &lt;b&gt;God has given unto us a spirit of fear but of power, love and a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1.7 &lt;/b&gt;

Dont be cocky, by confident in Christ. Dont be brash, but be bold in The Lord. Dont be loud and condemning, but be loving and straightforward. The Holy Spirit will quicken you, and anoint you.God would never have opened the door only to have you or me shut our mouths.

Pastor Steven Cole writes this:

&lt;i&gt;We do not need Gods salvation and Christ did not need to die on the cross if were all basically good people who just need a little encouragement to be right with God. We do not need a crucified Savior if our main need is to polish our self-esteem and learn some helpful hints for happy living.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;We need a Savior who was crucified for our sins because we all by nature are ungodly rebels who are under Gods righteous wrath. This is offensive to the natural man, but if we pull our punches on this point, we miss the very heart of the gospel. The gospel is only good news to the person who realizes that he needs to be saved or he will eternally perish.&lt;/i&gt;

I want to be clear on a few very important things here.

Saving faith in Christ is not a general belief that He is the Savior. It is not an intellectual assent to the historic fact that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin and died on the cross. The demons believe that, but they are not saved. Rather, saving faith has three elements.

First, with the mind we must understand the content of the gospel: who Jesus is, what His death on the cross means, and that He was raised from the dead.

Second, we must have a heart response to the truth of the gospel, where we agree that it is true and our agreement causes our hearts to be sorrowful about our sin, but also to rejoice in the free offer of Gods grace.

Third, saving faith includes commitment to Christ, where we trust in Him and His death on the cross as our only hope of eternal life and we follow Him as Lord. Saving faith is not a work that we do, but rather simply receiving all that God offers to us in Christ. It is the hand that receives the free gift of God.

Perhaps some of you are at that place of making that decision right now. You would ask me, Pastor Ray, what must I do to be saved? I would say to you repent of your sin, believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, confess Him as Lord, and begin to follow Him as Lord of your life. If that is you right now, do not grieve the Spirit of grace. &lt;a href="mailto:rviola@koinoniafellowship.com"&gt;Write me&lt;/a&gt; and I will do my best to answer any questions you have and pray with you.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;The Apostle Paul, from prison, is encouraging the Philippian believers to be united in the Spirit; but what do you do when you run into or are the subject of strife or Spirit-quenching drama within the church? Our tendency is to murmur and complain, or run and retaliate...the answer is to go to the cross where we have sinned or sins have been committed against us and repent and or forgive, and see the grace and love of Jesus cover that situation. We are called as Christians to "work out what God is working in us."&lt;/em&gt;

In this very significant section of the letter, Paul urged thechurch members to dismiss their pride and to live and serve together in unity. Anything less falls short of the gospelsstandards. True unity will be realized by authentic meeknessand selflessness, ultimately exemplified in the earthly life of Jesus. The attitude the church should exhibit was the oneJesus demonstrated.

In our fitness-crazed culture, people often refer to working out the chest, arms, or legs. Some work out with weights, others prefer cardio. But in these first two verses, Paul speaks of working out the unity in the body of Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;12Wherefore, my beloved (Paul loved these saints like afather), as ye have always obeyed, not as in mypresence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul is not talking about ones individual salvation fromhell. Instead, he is commanding the church tocorporately work out their salvation (soteria) orpresent deliverance by applying the truths Paulelaborated upon in 2:611.

This working out here refers to the Philippiansresponsibility put off the old man and their selfcentered ambitions and attitudes that were in actualityhindering the ongoing process of sanctification and wasquenching the Spirit of God. Work out amongyourselves is the exhortation.

Beloved, the attitude with which we as a church familyso desperately need if we intend to grow in grace andsanctification is one that is rooted in a cross centered,Christ exalting fear of offending God and a righteousawe and respect for Him and one another (cf. Prov. 1:7;9:10; Isa. 66:12)

The phrase fear and trembling (awe and reverence)portrays the attitude every believer should have towardGod whenever they are confronted with carnal anddivisive attitudes that stand in stark contrast to thehumility displayed by The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/76828878"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Work out, not work for your own salvation. The gospelof Jesus Christ is not a gospel of works that gives gloryto fallen man, but a gospel of unconditional andsovereign grace that gives glory to God and God alone.Many cults and Christian denominations preach agospel of works. They preach a Christ +something=salvation. And this is one of the manyScriptures that they misquote out of context as a prooftext of their position.

Beloved, Jesus said on the cross that It is finished. Thesalvation of God as revealed in Scripture is one that isgiven by grace alone through Christ alone in Christalone (and I am going to add a new phrase) to the gloryof God alone!&lt;!--more--&gt;

The legalists and cults insist that Paul tells us to workout your own salvation with fear and trembling, butthey fail to read the very next verse declares, 13For it is God which worketh in you (among you) bothto will and to do of his good pleasure.

Where does the desire to work out your salvation withfear and trembling come from in the first place? Itcomes from God. These people have already beenaddressed as saints in Christ Jesus (Phil 1.1). Thusthey are already saved.

They have already experienced the reality of the newbirth spoken of by God, in that day, I will no longerwrite My law on tables of stone, but I will writethem on the fleshly tablets of their hearts.
(Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 11:19; 2 Corinthians 3:3)

So work out your own salvation, yes, with fear andtrembling, but realize its God that is working inyou! It is God that works in you both to will and then Heis the One that gives the ability to do it! It is God thatworks in you both to will and then gives to you the capacity and power of doing. So it is He that works inyou both to will and to do of His good pleasure.

And what is the context of this statement to work outyour salvation with fear and trembling? It iswritten in the context of unacceptable conduct andbehavior in light of who they are in Christ.

In chapter 1 we learned that instead of being driven bythe love of Christ to preach the gospel and reach thelost, some were driven by the false motives of prideand pretense.

In chapter 2 we saw that instead of walking insubmission to The Father and humility like Jesus did asSon of Man, they were walking around striving with oneanother and envying one another.

In chapter 4, we will see that there were 2 prominentladies in this congregation who could not see eye to eyein some area of ministry within this congregation.

Beloved, whenever there is striving and envy orcompetition and bad attitudes within any congregation,it is a clear indication that our eyes are off The Lord andthe message of the cross and on ourselves and ourfeelings or rights.

It is in the context of working out these personal and relational issues that Paul exhorts them to work out their salvation with fear and trembling. With fearand trembling means to give some real thought to what youre doing. Work out your salvation soberly and thoughtfully.

Why? For it is God Who is at work in you both towill and to do of His good pleasure. Does thatmean that God is the author of striving and envy andbad attitudes? Absolutely not! It means that God isallowing these fleshly attitudes to come to the surfacein order that we might realize that we need to lookafresh at the cross and example of humilitydemonstrated by Jesus.

Just as Jesus obeyed always for the glory of The Father,we too are to humble ourselves reach out to oneanother in love and grace deal for the glory of God.  Each of us needs to seriously consider whether or not there is something in our lives that is discrediting the name and Person of Christ. When we realize what He has done for us, we ought to tremble as we stand in thepresence of a holy, righteous, almighty God.

Not only do we stand in His presence now, but we will also stand in His presence when we give account at the Judgment Seat of Christ.

For His good pleasure- In Revelation 4.11 we read,and for Thy pleasure we are created. The primarypurpose of each and every Christian is to live a life thatis pleasing to The Father and reflective of Jesus Christ.And a major part of pleasing The Father has to do withhaving God glorifying attitudes with one another.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And herein do I exercise myself, to have always aconscience void of offence toward God, andtoward men. (Acts 24:16).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Personal obedience + divine enablement=His goodpleasure. It is only as we cooperate with Him that wesee the true potential of our lives realized. Both sides ofthe coin are needed: dependence (Gods sovereignty)and discipline (human responsibility)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;14Do all things without murmurings and disputings:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
A man decided to join a monastery and one of therules of the group was that you were only allowed tospeak two words every ten years. At the end of tenyears he said, "Bad food!" Ten more years went by andhe said, "Hard bed!" Finally, on his 30th anniversarywith the brothers, he thundered, "I quit!" And thepriest in charge responded, "You might as well. Allyou do is complain anyway."

Seriously speaking, murmuring is low-toned,discontented muttering. It is negative, mutedcomments, complaining, and whining. You can identify agrumbler from yards away by their body language.Grumblers often wear frowns, appear visibly weary, andincessantly shake their head. They also like to sighdeeply. This typically causes caring persons to ask,Whats wrong? The grumbler then responds with a listof grievances. And lets face it beloved; the devil knowsthat the poison of pessimism and criticism affects ourunity and quenches The Spirit of God.

Do you know why The Spirit of God prompted Paul towrite this warning to the Philippians about murmuringand complaining? Because this congregation (and everycongregation) needed to know the seriousconsequences of murmuring and complaining (Readslowly and prayerfully James 3.1-10).

How many of you know that murmuring and complaining is sin and displeasing to God? Both murmuring and disputing characterized the children of Israel in the wilderness.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ex 16.8 The LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us (Moses &amp;amp; Aaron), but against the LORD.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Num 14.27 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A careful reading of 1 Cor 10 and the accounts of the complaining children of Israel in the wilderness will reveal how their murmuring in their tents literally destroyed them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Cor 10.10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Complaining about our lot in life might seem quite innocentin itself, but God takes it personally.ERWIN W. LUTZER (1941 )

Disputings- The Greek word for disputing in our textsliterally means, questionings or doubtings. This is not arebuke of sincere questioning of why God is allowingthis to happen in my life? This word refers to ill-naturedargumentation, verbal expressions of disagreementthat stir up suspicions and distrust, doubt, and otherdisturbing feelings in others.

What message does a murmuring, grumbling andcomplaining Christian send to those who have yet tocome to Christ as Lord?

What impact does murmuring and complaining have onthe unity within the local church?

Beloved, murmuring and complaining will severelydamage your spiritual immune system and the flow ofThe Spirit of God in your life. As we will see in amoment, we are called to be a light to a fallen andcorrupt world. But if we are murmuring and complainingwithin the church as much as the unsaved aremurmuring and complaining outside of the church, whatis the difference between us and them? Why would theythink that they need what we have?

Let me be very transparent here beloved. I am notnave to think that the leadership here is without sinand beyond making mistakes. The right way to expressthose concerns or problems is with us face to face inorder that we might hear your heart and seek to cometo a solution that glorifies God. To spread half truths orpersonal dissatisfaction amongst yourselves is sowingdiscord and is one of the things that God says He hatesin Proverbs.

Brothers and sisters, we are in this battle together. Asbrothers and sisters in Christ, we must seek toovercome sin together as a church family. We must doeverything we can to promote health and holinessamong ourselves. We must keep short accounts andseek to go to every length possible to avoid grumblingand disputing.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sonsof God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked andperverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights inthe world;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Blameless- describes a life that cannot be criticizedbecause of sin or evil. Harmless (innocent)- describes a life that is pure,unmixed, and unadulterated with sin. No hypocrisy. Oneway of talking and acting in front of people at church onSunday and another way of talking and acting in frontof my peers at my college dorm or workplace.

Crooked is the word from which the English scoliosis(curvature of the spinal column) comes. It describessomething that is deviated from the standard, which istrue of all who stray from Gods path (cf. Prov. 2:15;Isa. 53:6).

Perverse (twisted) intensifies this meaning byreferring to a person who has strayed so far off the paththat his deviation is severely distorted (cf. Luke 9:41).Paul applies this condition to the sinful world system.Crooked and perverse are reminders that fallen man ittotally depraved.

When Paul refers to a crooked and perversegeneration, he is alluding to the song of Moses inDeuteronomy 32:5. In the bittersweet song Mosesgave to the assembly of Israel just prior to his exodusfrom this earth, he sharply contrasted the faithfulnessof God and the faithlessness of His people. In a sense,the Israelites were working out their salvation in thewilderness. Unfortunately, there is a whole lot ofgrumbling and complaining.

Did you catch how resisting the temptation to murmurand dispute is connected with being a blameless andharmless witness in a crooked and fallen world?

Yes, our light should so shine before men that whenthey see your good works they glorify your Father thatis in heaven. But may I add this morning that our lipsand language should shine as well.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;16Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice inthe day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neitherlaboured in vain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The phrase holding forth here carries the idea thatbelievers are to be so committed to Jesus Christ and theglory of The Father that in doing so, we are holding outor offering something for others to take. It is similar tooffering a life jacket to a drowning man.

Run- Like the runner who trains &amp;amp; trains, then pulls ahamstring right before the race, all that running wasfutile.

Labored- like a farmer working in the field.

Beloved, the real test of our commitment to Jesus Christis not measured by how you act within this sanctuarythis Sunday, but by how you live at home, at work or atschool.

To prevent disunity from extinguishing the testimony ofa church, we must hold fast the word of life. That is,we must obediently achieve Jesus unity. A true gospelwitness demands a deliberate effort to live a truegospel lifestyle.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice andservice of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Paul sees himself as a drink offeringone that has beenpoured out for Jesus and others. In the sacrificial systemunder the Old Covenant, the priests would take theanimal sacrifices and spread them on the altar to beconsumed by fire. Then they would take a drink offeringand pour it on top of that searing hot flame. Inevitably,the liquid would turn into steam and it would go up in a
wisp of smoke. Paul is saying: I love you people, and Iam here to serve you and to sacrifice for you. Ifnecessary, I am willing for my life to just go up in steamto the Lord that I may be a blessing to you.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;18For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In other words, if Caesar takes my life, dont be sorrowing. I want you to rejoice with me.

Beloved, wherever there is a surrendered heart andmind to the will and purposes of God, there will besacrifice and service. To be a living sacrifice unto Jesuswill always involve a cost.

Beloved, the realization that The Creator of theuniverse has plans for your life and works within you tofulfill those plans is a cause of great rejoicing today.

The same holds true of this congregation. The mostoutstanding singular purpose of The Spirit of Godworking is us is to conform us into the image of Jesus
Christ.

When The Spirit of God exposes an area of the flesh, itis not to condemn us, but to serve us notice that it isinconsistent with the message of the cross.

What part of today message hit home for you? Whatspecific areas of the flesh did the light of Gods Wordexpose? What do you plan to do to address thesituation in a biblical, God glorifying way?

May the truths that we heard today not fall upondeaf ears. To repeatedly hear and neglect acting onGods truth will cause a hardening of the heart.

May we all for the glory of God look to the cross of Jesusand together, work out our salvation with fear andtrembling, for it God working in us both to willand to do of His good pleasure.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;What are the ingredients for faithful and fruitful service within the local church? The Apostle Paul points to two men who served sacrificially and selflessly on behalf of him and the church.; are we comfortable in our chairs or are we motivated by grace to step out and serve the Lord?&lt;/em&gt;

By Pastor Ben Hiwale

You've Got Mail! This slogan was made a household name by AOL. It resonated with us because we all love getting mail - not bills, but cards and letters. We all love reading our mail. There is a curiosity in most of us, as embarrassing it is to admit, to read other peoples mail. Many of the books of the Bible were addressed to someone; therefore you and I are reading someone elses mail. No one is alive that can say that the book of Philippians was written to me personally, but it is relevant to all of us. It is one of the most encouraging letters in the Bible, and gives us a very close and personal view of Paul.

Much of Christian Character is &lt;em&gt;caught&lt;/em&gt; as much it is taught. That is, it is picked up by constant association with mature Christians. The question that is addressed in this chapter isnt - will we learn by watching others? rather  what will we learn and from whom we shall learn it? Who are your friends? Your friends are important because all of us tend to become like the people we associate with. If you hang around complainers, pretty soon youll start to complain. If your friends are selfish, their attitude will rub off on you. But if your friends are noble, their nobility will make you noble too.

Every person needs three types of friendships. Samuel  someone who makes us better, Jonathan  who gives Spiritual Strength and Nathan  who tells you the truth.Who are your heroes, the people you look to as role models? Tell me your heroes and Ill tell you your values. Paul points to two men worth watching and following. We'll get to them later, but first, let's take a look at a passage about Jesus and his disciples.

Read John 6:66  68. There are going to be times in your life that we all are going to come across things that will make you think about "unfollowing" Jesus. Times of transition: high school to college, college to marriage, marriage to children. You are not unfollowing because it's not true, very few people do that. People quit following because its too hard, it's inconvenient and isolating, you're all alone and it just doesnt seem to matter. It's relational as well, sometimes your relationship with Jesus gets in the way of you getting into a relationship with someone who is not a believer. Guys think, not everyone is beautiful, and anyone can become a Christian, so why not take a chance on this girl? This Jesus thing is just getting in the way.

Or maybe you have been praying and praying, believing and believing and it's frustrating because God has been quiet. You thought if you obeyed things will work out and they havent. So you are tempted to unfollow. Peter, who as we know has a habit of putting his foot in his mouth, asks a question that I want to write on your mind, heart and soul today so that every time you get in that place of being tempted to unfollow or quit on Jesus you think about it. In that passage in John, Peter asks " To whom shall we go?" When you choose not to follow Jesus, you are choosing to follow someone or something else. If not Jesus, who? If not Jesus, what? Think about this before you quit.&lt;!--more--&gt;

One can be tempted to conclude that this is nothing but a little conversation between Paul, Timothy and the Philippian church.It seems that Paul is saying Timothy is on his way and Epaphroditus is coming soon. But as you zoom in, it is much more than a travel itinerary.

After the Exhortation and Imperatives in verses 12-18, Paul transitions from Imperatives to Living Illustrations. This goes back to the verse we saw a few weeks ago 1:27  Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ. Or chapter 2:5  Let the same mind be in you... they may have seemed like abstract thoughts before, but here Paul gives us a demonstration of what they mean.

Alexander Maclaren wrote, Many a professing Christian life has a veneer of godliness nailed thinly over a solid bulk of selfishness.

Sometimes we are just &lt;strong&gt;making a point&lt;/strong&gt; and never &lt;strong&gt;making a difference&lt;/strong&gt;. It is always easier to make a point than to make a difference.

A non-serving Christian is a contradiction of terms.

This passage: Speaks to 5 Broad Concepts
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People before Profits (19-21)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Character before Conformity (22-24)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Teamwork before Competition (25)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Kingdom before Comfort (26-27)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Service before Security (28-30)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Going back to the question this Text raises is: What shall we learn? And from Whom shall we learn it?

Who are the men that Paul points to as worthy of being your role models? Timothy and Epaphroditus. What we learn from Paul is that these men were:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Available&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sensitive&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you have been praying and waiting on the Lord for you to show you how, where and when to serve then you must evaluate:

Are you &lt;strong&gt;Available&lt;/strong&gt; to the Lord? To the Church He has placed you in? You must also evaluate if you are S&lt;strong&gt;ensitive&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning genuinely interested in the welfare of others. Third, can everyone &lt;strong&gt;rely on you&lt;/strong&gt; to complete the tasks you are given? What good is a person that is available but not sensitive, what good is a person that is available and sensitive but not reliable?

May the Lord lead you through this message to bear the fruit in His Kingdom.</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;What is your spiritual resume? What would you list as those things which "define" your life? Whatever the answer to that question is, it will be the thing that tells you, "You are ok." The Apostle Paul lists his righteous resume before Christ and called it a pile of poop. The Bible doesn't mince words when it comes to describing our attempts to make ourselves righteous...you will either find your righteousness in Christ or in yourself. Which is it for you?&lt;/em&gt;

By Pastor Ben Hiwale

The book of Philippians was written out of a situation where Paul is not being blessed. He has been seized, dragged, falsely accused, clothes torn off, beaten and put in the stockade. And yet this book overwhelmingly speaks of his joy and peace and happiness.

As I mentioned when we were looking at Philippians 1, one of the biggest problems we have living this Christian life and finding peace, joy and happiness is due to the fact that we have a terrible understanding of suffering. I heard one of the Faith teachers say recently that, for him, walking in favor with God is getting a good parking spot at the mall. If that was true, then Paul is definitely not walking in favor with God. Not only did he not get a good parking spot, his car got stolen and he got put into prison!

From my perspective, if the church fired me, people lied about me, I was put in prison, my reputation was ruined, my friends and colleagues turned on me  how many of you would say our Pastor just got blessed? That doesnt compute for us. Maybe where you work, you work hard but someone else gets the credit for your ideas, they get the promotion and you get laid off. By the way, this happens to Gods people all the time. Do we say they just got blessed?&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/77969958"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
No, you say, I cant believe this is actually happening to me! I am really serving God and doing what he wants me to do! Unless we understand what is going on in the book of Philippians, circumstances are going to have the potential to wreck your life and wreck your faith. They are going to cause you to get depressed, angry and angry at God.

So the Book of Philippians is giving you an entirely new way, a radical and revolutionary way at looking at life. Paul is not giving us a band-aid with a smiley face to stick over the problems we face. Our youngest son Andrew went through a phase where no matter what happened, he thought that a band-aid fixed it all. So until he got a band-aid on, he couldnt think beyond that.

In the U.S., being a Christian has its benefits and advantages. However, at some point in your Christian journey you are going to come to a place where things are going to be hard. You will have to give some things up. It will cost you something. You will know when that moment comes; some of you may be facing it right now.

Our response to that moment and the decisions we make then will determine two things about you. It will determine whether you will continue to be a consumer Christian or become a Follower. A consumer says, this Bible is filled with incredible principles about finance, marriage, life, discipline, purity, morality, intimacy, so you consume those ideas. Thats OK, theres nothing wrong with that, because Jesus wanted people to follow Him. He fed them, healed them, provided for them, instructed them. Jesus understood Consumerism, but he also modeled a life where you go from consumer to follower.

In Jesus time there were consumers and followers, just like they are in our times. I have to admit that at times I have gone back and forth between being a consumer and a follower. When we received Jesus Christ in your heart, we all become consumers. Jesus is our Savior, He did something for us  saved us, had mercy on us.

At some point you bump into something at one of those stages where you realize you need to become a follower, and its going to cost you something.

Now that Jesus is our Lord, &lt;i&gt;we &lt;/i&gt;want to do something for &lt;i&gt;Him&lt;/i&gt;. Thats what Paul is talking about this passage. Salvation is free  it cost you nothing - but following Christ will cost you something. Not only will it cost you something, but there will be no return on the price you pay. In that moment you will learn something about yourself, and hopefully in that incredibly intense moment, you will decide and make the transition from consumer to follower.

There is a severe warning against false teachers. Judaizers that we read about in Acts 15:1. They believed that unless a person was circumcised and followed Mosaic cleansing disciplines you were not saved. This text is profoundly theological and deeply personal. Theologically it is speaking of salvation, justification, sanctification and glorification; personally, it shows the effects of the gospel and a radical reorientation of ones life.

We summarize this passage: The most valuable thing is Knowing Christ and Becoming like Him.

The Four Pillars:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Righteousness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Power&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The most fundamental human need is for righteousness. All of us find it somewhere. When you are younger, your righteousness is usually your talents, your dreams, or your marriage. When you become a Follower, you trade in your righteousness for Jesus.

The second thing you gain when you become a Follower is the Knowledge of God. Before we surrender to Him we think we will be happy if we just distinguish ourselves over others. We try to build a great and glorious resume. When we become a Follower, we trade all that for truly knowing the Glorious One  Christ.

Jesus wants us to know the power of His resurrection. We live in fear, always looking for power and control. When we become a Follower, we trade in our power for His. That is a good trade. You look at the list of your accomplishments and its really not that impressive. Paul had a good one and he considered it worse than worthless

Paul says, I have an assured hope for the future; I want to attain the resurrection of the dead. When you become a Follower, you have no fears about the future; you know it is all going to work out.

Bottom line: The Cross saves you, but it also should also shape you!</ns3:encoded>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contentment...not a popular buzz word in our society, but Biblically there is a connection between goodliness and contentment. From a prison cell, the Apostle Paul in his closing comments address' the need for our hearts to be focused, above, on others, and on eternity, not ourselves. The key to contentment is a satisfaction in Christ!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.10-14 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If our understanding of what contentment is and where it comes from is not rooted in Scripture, the pursuit of contentment can become an ever-elusive black hole. We go after what we think will make us happy only to find that it didnt work. A new car, a new home, a new look, and yes, sad to say, a new husband or wife. Only to find that after the initial shine wears off, we are just as discontented and empty as we were before we began the quest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Its like the story of two teardrops floating down the river of life. One teardrop said to the other, Who are you? Im a teardrop from a girl who loved a man and lost him. Who are you? Im a teardrop from the girl who got him.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was a story posted in Readers Digest about a Jewish man in Hungary who went to his rabbi and complained, &lt;i&gt;Life is unbearable. There are nine of us living in one room. What can I do&lt;/i&gt;? The rabbi answered, &lt;i&gt;Take your goat into the room with you&lt;/i&gt;. The man was incredulous, but the rabbi insisted, &lt;i&gt;Do as I say and come back in a week&lt;/i&gt;. A week later the man returned looking more distraught than before. &lt;i&gt;We cant stand it&lt;/i&gt;, he told the rabbi. &lt;i&gt;The goat is filthy&lt;/i&gt;. The rabbi said, &lt;i&gt;Go home and let the goat out, and come back in a week&lt;/i&gt;. A week later the man returned, radiant, exclaiming, &lt;i&gt;Life is beautiful. We enjoy every minute of it now that theres no goat-- only the nine of us&lt;/i&gt;. Perspective helps, doesnt it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
One would think that the person to tell us how to be content would the man or woman who has it all together. They have the killer looks, the killer bodies, the 6 figure income, a mansion (or 2), and all of the perks and creature comforts that one could ever desire. Right? Wrong. Ask Solomon. In Ecclesiastes, he tells us that he had it all. But what word did he use to explain what having it all is like apart from a genuine, transforming rebirth by The Spirit of God through faith in Jesus Christ? Vanity. Emptiness.&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/80371937"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Jesus told the woman at the well, &lt;b&gt;If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep:from whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life (John 4.10-14).&lt;/b&gt;

I find it interesting that here in &lt;b&gt;Philippians 4:10-13&lt;/b&gt;, Paul the apostle is sitting in a Roman prison cell because of corrupt officials awaiting possible execution over false charges. He has next to nothing in the way of furniture or creature comforts and his daily food rations would be less than what the everage American would feed their pet cat or dog. And The Holy Spirit anoints him to tell us (&lt;i&gt;the vast majority of whom live in suburbia America&lt;/i&gt;) how to find contentment.

A little bit of background here.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ten years had passed since Pauls ministry in Philippi had resulted in the founding of the church in that city. The Philippians had generously supported him when he left Philippi to minister in the Macedonian cities of Thessalonica and Berea (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Acts%2017.1-13"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 17:1-13&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). When Paul moved south into Achaia, the Philippians continued their support as he ministered in Athens and Corinth (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Acts%2017.14-18.18"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 17:14-18:18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As the years passed they had consistently been concerned about Paul, but lacked any opportunity to provide support for him... But recently opportunity arose when Epaphroditus arrived in Rome, bringing with him a generous gift from the Philippians (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Php%204.18"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Php 4:18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) for which Paul rejoiced in the Lord greatly.(&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802452620?v=glance"&gt;MacArthur, J. Philippians. Chicago: Moody Press&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In our texts he is expressing his heartfelt thanks, but at the same time he doesnt want to give the impression that the Lord was not sufficient for his every need.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even though Paul had been in a very difficult situation (&lt;b&gt;4:14, affliction&lt;/b&gt;), he didnt want these precious saints to think that he had been discontented &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; their gift arrived. But on the other hand, he does want them to know that their generosity was truly appreciated. So he combines his thanks with this valuable lesson on the secret for contentment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note in verse 11 that contentment was something that Paul had learned. &lt;i&gt;Just as our Lord "learned obedience by the things that He suffered," so the Apostle acquired the habit of contentment by practising it. He had schooled himself, by constantly applying the Cross of Jesus to his ambitions, his murmurings, his tendency to complain. He had accustomed himself to dwell upon the bright side of things, to lay more stress upon what he had than upon what he lacked.&lt;/i&gt; F.B Meyer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So what does contentment mean? Webster defines it this way: &lt;i&gt;the feeling or manifestation of satisfaction with ones possessions, status, or situation. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is an inner sense of rest or peace that comes from being right with God and knowing that He is in control of all that happens to us. It means having our focus on the kingdom of God and serving Him, not on the love of money and things. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The secret for contentment in every situation is to know that The Lord Jesus Christ is (1) the Sovereign One and God of providence to whom I must submit; (2) He is the Savior whom I must serve; (3) He is the Sufficient One whom I must trust.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;True contentment in life comes from submitting to the absolute, providential Lordship of Jesus Christ. It is the realization that it is in those circumstances, The Lord is giving unto us an opportunity to proclaim to a lost and materialistic world that Jesus Christ is our all-sufficiency. supremacy of His grace and majesty in our lives!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 73.25,26 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;While Paul was in prison, he wrote a number of letters during this time to various churches and individuals (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon), and he asks for prayer in those letters. But never once does he mention his financial needs. Rather, he asks for prayer for boldness and faithfulness in his witness. He trusted in and submitted to the sovereignty of God to provide for his needs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In our materialistic culture that we live in, we need to learn like Paul did that contentment (peace of heart, mind, soul and strength) comes from who we are in Christ and by setting our affections on things above, not on tings of the earth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus put it this way, &lt;b&gt;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Matt. 6:33).&lt;/b&gt; All what things? Read the context. It refers to what you shall eat, what you shall drink, what you shall wear (&lt;b&gt;6:25&lt;/b&gt;). No cell phone or x-box? No mansion because Im a kings kid?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus was teaching that if we will make the priority in our lives seeking Him and His kingdom, The Father will take care of our basic material needs. &lt;i&gt;Please take note that He promises to supply our needs, not our greed.&lt;/i&gt; Beloved, the opposite of contentment is covetousness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Most of us living in America have far, far more than what we need. Compared to the majority of other people on the planet, the vast majority of us this morning are living in relative luxury, &lt;i&gt;even if we live in a house that is too small or only have one car&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes we need to remember that people in other countries squeeze ten family members into a one-room, dirt-floored shanty.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Contentment is a gospel-centered discipline that comes from focusing on the Lord as the Sufficient One whom I must trust. Paul says that he had &lt;b&gt;learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need&lt;/b&gt;. In times of need, we need a trusting heart. In times of abundance, we need a thankful heart.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This subject of being content in any situation is the context of the oft-quoted passage, &lt;b&gt;I can do all things through Christ Who strengthens me&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, many people take this verse out of context and use it to reinforce a "triumphalist" or "super-Christian" mentality. Some take it to mean that if I were to have a 500 pound bar bell on the platform this morning, all I would need to do to lift it over my head would be to confess &lt;b&gt;Philippians 4.13&lt;/b&gt; over and over again. How do you spell hernia????&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This passage described the strength of Jesus in Paul's life &lt;b&gt;to be content&lt;/b&gt; when he had abundance and when he &lt;b&gt;suffered need&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We cannot quote Phil 4.13 without &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jhn&amp;amp;c=15&amp;amp;v=5#s=1012005"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 15:5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: for without Me you can do nothing.&lt;/b&gt; With Jesus we can do all things, without Him we can't do anything. The emphasis in Phil 4.13 &lt;i&gt;is not I can do, but Christ. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 13.5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Timothy 6.6 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;But godliness with contentment is great gain. 6.7 for we brought nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. 6.8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;15-18 Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this refers to Paul's pioneering missionary efforts in Europe, recorded in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=16&amp;amp;v=1-40#s=1034001"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acts 16&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and following&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only. For even in Thessalonica you sent &lt;i&gt;aid&lt;/i&gt; once and again for my necessities. Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account. Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things &lt;i&gt;sent&lt;/i&gt; from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul described the gift of the Philippians in terms that remind us of sacrifices in the Old Testament (&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;amp;c=8&amp;amp;v=21#s=8021"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis 8:21&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Exd&amp;amp;c=29&amp;amp;v=18#s=79018"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exodus 29:18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Exd&amp;amp;c=29&amp;amp;v=25#s=79025"&gt;&lt;b&gt;29:25&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Exd&amp;amp;c=29&amp;amp;v=41#s=79041"&gt;&lt;b&gt;29:41&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Our giving to God's work is similar to Old Testament sacrifices, which also cost the person bringing the sacrifice a lot. Bulls and rams did not come cheaply in that day. Biblical giving is always sacrificial. Biblical giving is not tipping God 10% for doing another great job this week!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweet smelling aroma&lt;/b&gt;- Paul knew that these people made this sacrifice not only out of love for him but because of love for God and that He would be glorified. The word aroma is used to refer to the burning of incense in the temple that was done as an act of worship. Paul describes their extravagant giving as a form of worship.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well pleasing to God&lt;/b&gt; - When people perform acts of kindness to those who are in service to God, it is as if they are performing them directly to God Himself as an act of worship. IN as much as we do it unto one another, we do it unto Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want to point out here beloved that giving isnt Gods way of raising funds. God does not have telethons to keep heaven operating. Giving is Gods way of raising children whose hearts are rich toward Him. One pastor wrote, God raises our standard of living so that we can raise our standard of giving.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you are a Christian, then you will want to give. In&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Corinthians%209.7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Corinthians 9:7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Paul states: &lt;b&gt;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%209.7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Cor 9:7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word translated cheerful is the same word we get our word hilarious. God loves extravagant, joyful, hilarious givers who realize that the can not out give God. Jesus said,&lt;b&gt;It more blessed to give than to receive&lt;/b&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Acts%2020.35"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 20:35&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;19 But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the promise to the cheerful giver? God will supply all of our_______? What Paul tells these saints is that they will never be the poorer for having given unto The Lord. God will never be our debtor, and we can never out-give God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We shouldn't think that the Philippians were wealthy benefactors of Paul who could easily spare the money. As Paul described them in &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=2Cr&amp;amp;c=8&amp;amp;v=1-24#s=1086001"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 Corinthians 8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is plain that their giving was sacrificial. &lt;b&gt;2 Corinthians 8.1-5&lt;/b&gt; tells us that they gave &lt;i&gt;willingly&lt;/i&gt;, out of their own &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;, and they gave after &lt;i&gt;first having given themselves&lt;/i&gt; to the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;20 Now to our God and Father &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; glory forever and ever. Amen. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This was not some passing comment made by Paul. It was an expression of adoration and praise to God for His glorious provision for us in and through His Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jude 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romans 16.27 To God only wise, &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1Timothy 1.17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 3.20,21 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;21,22 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you. All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar's household.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul calls every born again believer as a &lt;b&gt;saint&lt;/b&gt; in Christ Jesus. This clearly states the fact that the title &lt;b&gt;saint&lt;/b&gt; applies to all Christians, not just to an elite few. The Catholic Church doesnt make saints, faith in The Lord Jesus Christ does.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even while in prison, God used Paul to bring many into the fold of Christ through the preaching of the gospel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
23 &lt;b&gt;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul did not say this to simply fill up space at the end of his letter. To him, the Christian life begins and ends with the &lt;b&gt;grace of our Lord Jesus Christ&lt;/b&gt;, so it was appropriate that his letters began and ended with &lt;b&gt;grace&lt;/b&gt; also.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Let me close with this:&lt;/span&gt; the Bible tells us not to be conformed to this world system (which is essentially discontented) but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Please get this beloved, contentment is a part of the process of sanctification that must be learned, for it is not natural, it is supernatural. Contentment is not a mellow temperament.

It is a myth for any one of us to believe that the value or worth of a persons life consists in the abundance of the things which he or she possesses. Sound familiar? It should, Jesus said it right there is &lt;b&gt;Luke 12.15. &lt;/b&gt;The worldly spirit of covetousness will spoil any possible experience of biblical contentment.

Have you repented of your sin and trusted in Christ alone as full payment of your sin debt? Jesus said In &lt;b&gt;Matthew 11.28,29&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Come unto Me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest. &lt;/b&gt;Then He says, &lt;b&gt;learn of Me and I you will find rest for your souls.&lt;/b&gt;

There are 2 rests spoken of here, one speaks of the rest of your soul knowing that by the grace of God, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ you are forgiven. Some of you here this morning have never been born again, but today is the day of salvation. Will you embrace Him as Lord and confess Him today as your Savior.

The other rest is a rest that is learned as we choose to follow Jesus Christit is a rest that is the process of sanctification whereby we are transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. This rest is a rest that frees is from the rat race of the world and is a rest of a peace and contentment that the world cannot give you.

Contentment is a battle that you and I are engaged in each and every day loved ones. Choose to live more for Christ and less for things, and you will find rest for your souls. May our daily prayer be that we would grow in Christ and grow in contentment.

		<title>Jesus: Our Great High Priest</title>

		<description />
		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our second Christmas series message, Pastor Ray Viola shares from the scriptures that Jesus is our Great High Priest. He stands for us to the Father and because of His blood, we have access to the Father, and forgiveness of sins. How do you pay for your sins? Is it your works, your religious affiliation, or the grace of God? Trust in the finished work of Christ on the cross as your sacrifice and Great High Priest!
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This very important doctrine that Jesus is our &lt;b&gt;High Priest&lt;/b&gt; is brought forth in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews is the only book that describes Jesus as our great high priest. &lt;b&gt;Psalm 110&lt;/b&gt; alludes to it, but the book of Hebrews explains it.

The doctrine of Jesus as high priest is first mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Hbr&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=17#s=1135017"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 2:17&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Hbr&amp;amp;c=3&amp;amp;v=1#s=1136001"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 3:1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;It is picked up here again in chapter&lt;b&gt; 4.14-510, and &lt;/b&gt;then further developed in&lt;b&gt; Hebrews 7.&lt;/b&gt;

It is important for us to remember that in the OT, the high priest was the appointed mediator between God and His people. Sinful man could not approach God apart from 2 things &lt;b&gt;(1)&lt;/b&gt; a sacrifice without blemish according to the law and &lt;b&gt;(2)&lt;/b&gt; an appointed priest of the sons of Aaron according to the law.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It was height of arrogance for any Jew to think that they could approach God apart from a God ordained sacrifice that was offered up by a God ordained priest. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The only way that any sinner can approach The Living God is by His appointed sacrifice and His appointed High Priest. There is not other way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Hebrews 4.14-5.6&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;4.14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No other priest was called great, for that title would be reserved for Jesus Christ, The Son of God. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus Christ is The One Mediator between God and man. As mans representative, He intercedes for us before God. As Gods representative, He assures us of Gods forgiveness.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John would write &lt;b&gt;if any man sin, we have an Advocate with The Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4.15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;David Guzik writes this&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sometimes we think that because Jesus is God, He could never know temptation the way we do. In part, this is true: Jesus faced temptation much more severely than we ever have or ever will. The Sinless One knows temptation in a way we don't, because only the one who never gives into temptation knows the full strength of temptation. It is true that Jesus never faced temptation in an inner sense the way we do, because there was never a sinful nature pulling Him to sin from the inside. But He knew the strength and fury of external temptation in a way, and to a degree, that we can never know. He knows what we go through; He has faced worse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4.16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between mercy and grace? Mercy is not getting what we deserve. Grace is getting what we do not deserve. Because of the sinless, perfect sacrifice of Our Great High Priest Jesus Christ, when we come before Him in prayer we &lt;b&gt;obtain mercy&lt;/b&gt; (this is &lt;i&gt;not getting&lt;/i&gt; what we deserve) &lt;b&gt;and find grace&lt;/b&gt; (this is &lt;i&gt;getting&lt;/i&gt; what we don't deserve) in our &lt;b&gt;time of need&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This passage is an invitation for sinners to come boldly unto the throne of grace. And here is the reason that makes such an invitation to come boldly possible. It is because we have a High Priest, The Lord Jesus Christ Who has passed into the heavens Who is both The Perfect Lamb of God and The Perfect High Priest.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is this a time of need for you beloved? The Spirit of God compels you to come boldly to the throne of grace for help in time of need. Yes, we all need help. Yes, none of us deserves the help we need. But look at what God says. Because we have a great High Priest, the throne of God is a throne of grace. And the help we get at that throne is mercy and grace to help in time of need. Grace to help! Not deserved help, gracious help.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is the whole point of the Old and New Testaments. God planned for a High Priest, a Savior, a Redeemer, a gracious Helper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/81398863"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5.1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;5.2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God established both the priesthood and the office of high priest in the days of Moses, as described in &lt;b&gt;Exodus 28. &lt;/b&gt;The primary responsibility of the high priest was to offer gifts and sacrifices for the sins of the people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that one of the essential virtues that every high needed was compassion. He was to minister the atoning sacrifices with a loving heart for the people and a deep reverence for God and His holiness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of the most beautiful pictures of the compassion of the high priest is given in &lt;b&gt;Exodus 28.4-30. &lt;/b&gt;There we read that in the breastplate of the &lt;b&gt;high priest&lt;/b&gt; were set twelve stones engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, and on the shoulder straps were stones engraved with the names of the tribes. In this, the people of Israel were always on the &lt;i&gt;heart&lt;/i&gt; and on the &lt;i&gt;shoulders&lt;/i&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;high priest&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Exd&amp;amp;c=28&amp;amp;v=4-30#s=78004"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exodus 28:4-30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This is a beautiful picture of The Lord Jesus Christ, our Great High Priest. He is moved with compassion for us, and He bears the name of each and every one of His sheep on His heart.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5.3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On the Day of Atonement, the &lt;b&gt;high priest&lt;/b&gt; had to sacrifice for himself first, to remind himself and the nation that he had sin to atone for, just like the rest of the people of Israel.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But here is another place where the types of Christ end, because Jesus Christ had no sin to atone for. Jesus was &lt;b&gt;made sin for us, He who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor 5.21). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 7.26-28 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus Christs sacrifice for sin was made once and for all and forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5.4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The office of high priest was nothing to aspire to or campaign for. Right of birth gave it, it was chosen by God. It was an honor no man could &lt;i&gt;take&lt;/i&gt; to himself.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5.5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;5.6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today I have begotten You&lt;/b&gt; refers to Jesus' resurrection from the dead. It was at the time of His bodily resurrection from the dead that Jesus fully assumed His role as our great High Priest. The resurrection of Jesus vindicated Jesus as the Father's &lt;i&gt;Holy One&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=2#s=1020002"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 2:2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=27#s=1020027"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:27&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Who bore the wrath sinners deserve, without becoming a sinner Himself.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus did not make Himself High Priest. Instead, just as much as Jesus was declared to be the &lt;b&gt;Son&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Psa&amp;amp;c=2&amp;amp;v=7#s=480007"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 2:7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), He was also declared to be &lt;b&gt;a priest forever&lt;/b&gt; (in &lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Psa&amp;amp;c=110&amp;amp;v=4#s=588004"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalm 110:4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;b&gt;A priest forever&lt;/b&gt; is not only an important contrast, but an important theological doctrine.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As stated earlier, the Levitical priesthood of the Jews was grounded in the order of Aaron, but the priesthood of Jesus Christ is grounded in the order of Melchizedek. The mysterious Melchizedek appeared in &lt;b&gt;Gen14:18-20&lt;/b&gt; and was not mentioned again until the messianic promise was made in &lt;b&gt;Psalm 110&lt;/b&gt; . The author of Hebrews drew from the OT witness to show that the order of Melchizedek was eternal in origin and scope.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Melchizedek participated in the divine attributes of eternity, righteousness, peace, and sovereignty.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His eternality is evident in that he was a priest foreverwithout beginning or end.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His righteousness is evident in His name since Melchizedek is Hebrew for king of righteousness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His peace is evident in the fact that he was also declared to be the King of Salem, which means king of peace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those who are born again&lt;/span&gt;

Since we have a great high priest Who by His blood has opened a new and living way for us to enter into the most holy place.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Let us draw near unto God in full assurance of faith (&lt;b&gt;Heb 10.22&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In spite of the adversities and difficulties that you are facing, do not draw back from running the race that God sets before you (&lt;b&gt;Heb 10.39&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine today and every day that you will preach the gospel to yourself and fix your eyes on Jesus, The Author and Finisher of our faith (&lt;b&gt;Heb 12.1,2&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In a day and age where being a Christian causes us to be the object of ridicule, mockery and rejection, let us be prepared to go outside the camp of society and bear reproach and humiliation for His Names sake (&lt;b&gt;Heb 13.13&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;For those who have yet to receive Christ as Lord &lt;/span&gt;

Last week we talked about the doctrine of the virgin birth from &lt;b&gt;Genesis 3.15 &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Luke 1.35. &lt;/b&gt;We saw in Scripture that the virgin birth of Jesus was necessary for Him to be the sinless, spotless Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.

If you don't believe in the virgin birth, you have some very serious theological problems.

Think about this today: Your salvation is inextricably interwoven with the doctrine of the virgin birth my friend. No virgin birth, no deity. No deity, no sinless life. No sinless life, no sacrificial death. No sacrificial death, no salvation. No salvation, you're going to hell. Jesus came to earth that we might go to heaven; born of a virgin that we might be born again. Thank God for the virgin birth of The Lamb of God.

To the Jews, the high priest was the highest religious authority in the land. And the most important part of his ministry was when he entered alone the Holy of Holies once a year to make atonement for the sins of the whole nation (&lt;b&gt;Lev 16&lt;/b&gt;). Thank God for our Great High Priest, Jesus Christ. Listen with your heart to the word of The Living God.

&lt;b&gt;Heb 9.11-15 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Heb 9.24-26 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world:but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Heb 7.23-28 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. &lt;i&gt;Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What we have learned is this. IN The Lord Jesus Christ we have A &lt;b&gt;Great&lt;/b&gt; High Priest; A &lt;b&gt;Sympathetic&lt;/b&gt; High Priest; &amp;amp; An &lt;b&gt;Approachable&lt;/b&gt; High Priest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3.17&lt;/b&gt; tells us that Jesus &lt;b&gt;did not come into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;1 John 3.8 &lt;/b&gt;tells is &lt;b&gt;Jesus came into the world to destroy the works of the devil, not man&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;In Him is life, and the life is the light of men. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I beseech you in the Name of Jesus Christ to be reconciled to God. Jesus saves to the uttermost those who &lt;i&gt;come unto The Father by Him&lt;/i&gt;. Receive Him as &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;sacrificial lamb and great high priest today!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eternal life is &lt;b&gt;knowing The Father and His Son Jesus Christ (John 17.3). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If anyone &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;thirsts&lt;/span&gt;, let him &lt;b&gt;come&lt;/b&gt; to Me and drink. - "Let the &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;little children&lt;/span&gt; &lt;b&gt;come&lt;/b&gt; to Me, - "&lt;b&gt;Come&lt;/b&gt; to Me, all you who &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;labor&lt;/span&gt; and are &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;heavy laden&lt;/span&gt;, and I will give you rest.  And the Spirit and the bride say, "&lt;b&gt;Come&lt;/b&gt;!" And let him who hears say, "&lt;b&gt;Come&lt;/b&gt;!" And let him who thirsts &lt;b&gt;come&lt;/b&gt;. As we sing, I invite you to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we enter into another holiday season, we are once again confronted with the gap that exists between those who celebrate a holiday and those who worship Jesus Christ, The Lamb of God. If you were to poll the average Christmas shopper about what Christmas means to them, you would more times than not hear that it is all about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. They may mention that its all about family and giving and being cheerful. All of which are certainly an integral part of Christmas. But may we as evangelical Christians be bold in proclaiming that Jesus Christ was sent into the world to die for our sin, that we would find forgiveness of sin and deliverance from living a life of sin (John&lt;a&gt;3:14&lt;/a&gt;-20; Titus&lt;a&gt;2:11&lt;/a&gt;-15).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Philippians 2.8-11 &lt;/b&gt;is where we get the theme for our 2013 Christmas Series, Jesus, the Name above all Names. It reads this way.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him &lt;i&gt;a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus&lt;/i&gt; every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that &lt;i&gt;every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is my prayer that every knee would bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God The Father. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;May God be glorified in and through the preaching of His Word. May any who have yet to trust Christ alone for salvation be born of The Spirit into the kingdom by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Our first Name of Jesus is, Jesus, The Lamb of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Behold, The Lamb of God, Who taketh away the sin of the world. John 1.29&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus is The Lamb of God Who was &lt;b&gt;slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13.8). &lt;/b&gt;Jesus has always been the One and only way of salvation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Evidently the main aspect in which we are to view our Divine Lord, is in His sacrificial character. "&lt;b&gt;The Lamb as it had been slain&lt;/b&gt;" must be beheld both here and hereafter, in this world and in throughout all eternity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;When God delivered the nation of Israel out of the bondage that they were experiencing in Egypt, He did so by the blood of an innocent, sacrificial lamb placed on the doorposts of the house.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/80827925"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exodus 12.3-7 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man &lt;i&gt;a lamb&lt;/i&gt;, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: And if the household be too little for &lt;i&gt;the lamb&lt;/i&gt;, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. &lt;i&gt;Your lamb&lt;/i&gt; shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and &lt;i&gt;when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you&lt;/i&gt;, when I smite the land of Egypt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This lamb was to be without blemish. Also note that the progression from &lt;i&gt;a &lt;/i&gt;lamb, to &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;lamb to &lt;i&gt;your &lt;/i&gt;lamb. When God saw the blood of &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;lamb placed upon the 2 side posts and the upper door posts, He said He would He would pass over you. Instead of inflicting wrath that they deserved, God granted mercy and deliverance to them because of the power that was in the blood of The Lamb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The entire book of Leviticus is a book of redemption by grace through faith in the sacrifice of an innocent animal, slain on my behalf. The Bible is a message of redemption.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leviticus 17.11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This Hebrew word for &lt;b&gt;atonement &lt;/b&gt;here can also be translated &lt;i&gt;to cover, purge, make reconciliation&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A very interesting use of this Hebrew word is found in &lt;b&gt;Genesis 6.14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch(&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/Lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3722&amp;amp;t=KJV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;H3722&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;cover over with pitch)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; it within and without with pitch.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because of the application of the pitch on Noahs ark, the boat was kept afloat and spared from sinking during the time of the flood judgment. Likewise beloved, when the blood of Jesus Christ is applied to your soul by faith, the judgment and wrath of God is propitiated and you are legally declared right before God. That is good news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Back to our verse in &lt;b&gt;John 1.29, &lt;/b&gt;John is witnessing to the central reason for the incarnation of The Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;b&gt;To take away the sin of the world.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, this verse is so familiar to us in our day and age that it doesnt shock us, but it should. That was a radical thing for John to say about a young Galilean carpenter to a bunch of Jewish people who for centuries had offered their sacrificial lambs at the temple. What all of those centuries of sacrificial lambs symbolized, Jesus has come to fulfill, once and for all, taking away the sin of the world. This is clearly described in the book of Hebrews.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus was able to be the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world because he was the God-man. The Word became flesh (&lt;b&gt;1:14&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No sooner did Adam and Eve sin in the Garden of Eden, and God presents us with this incredible promise and prophecy of the virgin birth of The Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genesis 3.15&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the devil&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) and her seed (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;); it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In &lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20John%203.5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 3:5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. &lt;/b&gt;The reason why the Son of God appearedthe reason the Word became fleshwas to take away sin.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why did John add in &lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20John%203.5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 3:5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, And in him there was no sin?&lt;/b&gt; Because the lambs that were offered in sacrifice to take away sin in the Old Testament had to be spotless, without blemish. Listen to what the law demanded: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leviticus 4.32-35 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;However, we read in the book of Hebrews that the blood of animals cannot really take away sin (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Hebrews%2010.4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrews 10:4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That whole system was pointing forward to what would happen someday in a final sacrifice for sin. And John is saying: &lt;i&gt;Its happening now. God is sending his own Lamb into the world to take away sin, once and for all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When Peter describes how Jesus Christ redeems us from our sin, he writes &lt;b&gt;1 Peter 1.18-21 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is abundantly clear in Scripture that no mere man can redeem us from our sin. Sinners cannot redeem sinners. Pastors cannot redeem you. Priests cannot redeem you. Mary cannot redeem you. Angels cannot redeem you. Denominations cannot redeem you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that John He doesnt say, &lt;i&gt;Look at your good works; they will save you&lt;/i&gt;. He doesnt say, &lt;i&gt;Look at your religious rituals; they will put you in good stead on judgment day&lt;/i&gt;. He doesnt say, &lt;i&gt;Look at your religious heritage or your church attendance&lt;/i&gt;. He says, &lt;i&gt;Look to the Lamb of God&lt;/i&gt;! Jesus saves sinners who look in faith to Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
But look a bit deeper into exactly Who this Jesus is? Look at &lt;b&gt;John 1.23 I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias &lt;/b&gt;

John is quoting from &lt;b&gt;Isa 40.3-5 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Isaiah 40.3&lt;/b&gt; the LORD in Hebrew refers to Yahweh, Jehovah, the God who is the Creator and Ruler of the world, and the Covenant God of Israel. Now here is John the Baptist saying that he is that voice crying in the wilderness, and the Lord whose way he is preparing is Jesus Christ. In other words, the man coming after me is preferred before me because Jesus Christ is the God of the Old Testamentonly now He is man as well as God.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every man born in the ordinary way is a sinner. And sinners cant take away the sins of sinners. But Jesus was not born in the ordinary way. He was not born of two humans. He was the God-man because God ordained that the way the Word would become flesh would through a virgin birth.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luke 1.35 &lt;/b&gt;reads &lt;b&gt;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. &lt;/b&gt;The Scriptures take great care to reveal the importance of Jesus sinless nature, because ultimately it is tied in with our redemption.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
All of this talk about the sinless nature and deity of Jesus Christ is behind the words of John, &lt;b&gt;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&lt;/b&gt;? It meant two shocking things for the Jewsand both of them are relevant for us today.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, it meant that the God-man would die. And not just die, but die like a lamb diesbe &lt;i&gt;slaughtered&lt;/i&gt; (see the Greek &lt;i&gt;sphaz&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%205.6"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revelation 5:6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%205.9"&gt;&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%205.12"&gt;&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%2013.8"&gt;&lt;b&gt;13:8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Second, it meant that the whole world would benefit from His sacrificial death, and not just Jews. This God-man was the Jewish Messiah (see &lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%201.41"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:41&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But his death would take away the sin of the world, not just the sin of Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;Lamb of God means that Jesus is the &lt;i&gt;final &lt;/i&gt;Lamb and the &lt;i&gt;only &lt;/i&gt;Lamb that God has provided to take away our sins. There is no other. &lt;i&gt;Takes away &lt;/i&gt;signifies atonement, and that by substitution. &lt;b&gt;He was made sin for us Who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The phrase takes away in the Greek is in the present tense which means that he ongoing sufficiency of Jesus sacrifice and the fact that it is available at all times for every sinner who will trust in Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
John put it another way in his first letter: &lt;b&gt;He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20John%202.2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 2:2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Propitiation means that his death removes the wrath of God because it takes away sin. Thats what propitiation means. The Lamb takes away sin and removes Gods wrath, not just for Jews but for Gentiles scattered among all nations. &lt;b&gt;By your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe  (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%205.9"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revelation 5:9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the Messiah, &lt;b&gt;Isaiah &lt;/b&gt;uses the terms of a &lt;b&gt;sacrificial lamb &lt;/b&gt;in &lt;b&gt;Isa.53, He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, &amp;amp; as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John is declaring then, &lt;b&gt;Jesus &lt;/b&gt;is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;true sacrificial lamb &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;for the Passover. &lt;b&gt;1 Cor. 5:7 For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Christ dying for sinners and for the sin of the world is the gospel. But the atonement of Jesus Christ is not to be interpreted as meaning universalism.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3.36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Atonement sufficient for all is not atonement applied to all unless they repent of their sin and believe in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ &lt;i&gt;for their sin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Until a person is born again, the wrath of God abides upon them. That wrath can only be removed by grace alone, through faith alone in Christ alone. He died so that sinners who repent of their sin and trust in Him will not incur Gods judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is no race, no nationality, no ethnicity, no socio-economic status excluded. To as many as receive him, who believe on his name (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%201.12"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), their sins are taken away (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%201.29"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20John%203.5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 3:5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and the wrath of God is removed (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.36"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3:36&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20John%202.2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John 2:2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and they are made the children of God (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%201.12"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and given eternal life (&lt;a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.16"&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 3:16&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Jesus: Our Lamb and Our Lord. &lt;/b&gt;Everyone in this room is a sinner deserving of Gods wrath. To make the way for us to be saved, God The Father sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ to live a perfect divine-human life. And die an obedient death. In this way Jesus Christ became both the substitute punishment for our sins&lt;b&gt; (Matt 26.28; 1 Cor 15.3; 1 Peter 3.18) &lt;/b&gt;and the substitute performer of our righteousness&lt;b&gt; (Rom 5.19; 10.4; 2 Cor 5.21; Phil 3.9).&lt;/b&gt;

Therefore, in the courtroom of heaven, when I repent of my sin and receive Jesus Christ as Lord of my life, my debt of sin is removed by His blood&lt;b&gt; (Eph 1.7) &lt;/b&gt;and His righteousness is imputed unto me&lt;b&gt; (Rom 5.19). &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Blessing &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;honor &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;glory &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;power &lt;/b&gt;be to Him Who sits on the throne &lt;i&gt;Father&lt;/i&gt;), and to &lt;b&gt;the Lamb&lt;/b&gt;, forever and ever! &lt;b&gt;Rev. 5:13b&lt;/b&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;The Apostle Paul closes out his letter to the Philippian Church with some practical and powerful exhortations. How do you deal with people problems in the church? How do you handle worry? How do you manage your mind? How can God's peace fill our heart? Paul gives us practical and powerful instructions to navigate through these areas of church life and personal growth in Christ.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;b&gt;1Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Philippians were brethren in Christ who were dearly loved by Paul, his joy and crown.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They were dearly beloved by The Lord and in The Lord. His delight and yearning was to be with those that were his spiritual children in the Lord to impart further knowledge and spiritual enlightenment. They were a source of great joy to him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Longed for- &lt;/b&gt;The Greek term for long for refers to the deep pain of separation from loved ones.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippians 1:8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The apostle not only addresses the Philippians as his beloved, but shows the tenderness of his affection for them also by writing that he is yearning for them with a homesick longing, that his heart desires to be with them. That is the emotion that God has placed in my heart for you, my church family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My joy and my&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;crown.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Thessalonians 2:19 For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 20 For ye are our glory and&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;joy&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The term for crown (stephanos) is the word from which we derive the name Stephen. It relates to the laurel wreath placed around the neck or upon the head of the victor in an athletic contest. It was not at all like a diadem (diadema) worn by a ruler or priest of the day. The laurel began to wilt shortly after it was picked from a tree, so it was only transitory. On the other hand, the Philippian saints consisted of Pauls permanent joy and crown, or his reward for his labors in Philippi.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Paul had a genuine shepherds heart that saw the church as a source of joy and a crown in his life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stand fast in The Lord.&lt;/b&gt; Persevere; stand firm. Paul knew that the only way to stand fast and hold on to their faith in the midst of trials and adversity was to stand in the strength and power and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, we, like them, need to depend solely on Christ as the Author and Finisher of our faith; kept by the grace of God. We as Christians are to stand fast in the faith without wavering.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Corinthians 16:13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/79671991"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These two women definitely had assisted Paul in his ministry in Philippi . From the very genesis of the assembly, women filled prominent places in the Philippian church (&lt;b&gt;Acts 16:13ff.).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These two were appear to be prominent members of this church at Philippi , and who seem to have been at variance with each other. Talk about being exposed! This epistle was read before the entire congregation. Paul pleaded with them to settle whatever differences they had in The Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word behind the term &lt;b&gt;beseech&lt;/b&gt; (parakalo) is the same word from which we derive Paraclete, one of the prominent New Testament names for the Holy Spirit, the One who is the master pleader.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is unfortunate that the only thing we know about these two ladies, in addition to the fact that they labored with Paul when he ministered in Philippi, is that they could not get along and could not reconcile their differences. When Paul told them to &lt;b&gt;be of the same mind in the Lord&lt;/b&gt;, he used the same word as in 2:5 (phronein) where he instructed the Philippians to have the self less attitude of Christ. These 2 sisters did not have the option of packing up their bags and going to 1st Baptist or 2nd Presbyterian Church at Philippi. They had to get it right with God and one another.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want us all to ask ourselves two questions: (1) Am I at odds with anyone else in this church or any other congregation? If so, I need to work at getting the problem resolved. Unfortunately the contemporary answer to "solving" many our relationship issues is to just to pick up and move to another church. It may be hard work to deal with issues and it may require some painful self- confrontation. But for the glory of God and the love of Jesus, we are called to do it. Unresolved conflict often gives way to resentment, bitterness or malice. All of which effects your prayer life. Beloved, reconciliation is always Gods perfect will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoke fellow-&lt;/b&gt;The word translated yoke-fellow may be a proper noun, Synzygos, the name of one of the bishops or some other well-known member.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would you note that it is possible for a person to know that their names are written in the book of life before they die. Would you also note that people whose names are in the book of life are still very human and subject to relational problems and difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To often the Christian loses sight of this most important truth. We seem to find ourselves regularly in the slough of despair. I cannot always rejoice in the circumstances, but I can rejoice in the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Bible is realistic and balanced. We must look at the totality of Scripture rather than taking a verse like this as if it were all that is written on the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Psalms are helpful in this regard. The psalmist often is over- whelmed with despair or sadness, and he readily acknowledges his feelings of despair to God. He never puts on a happy face and denies the intensity of his troubles. But in the process of crying out to God for help and refocusing his thoughts on the Lord and His great mercies, by the end of the psalm his mood has changed, even though his circumstances are no different.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Its interesting that the shortest verse in the Greek New Testament is, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rejoice always&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (1 Thess. 5:16).&lt;/b&gt; The shortest verse in the English New Testament is, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesus wept&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (John 11:35).&lt;/b&gt; They are not contradictory! Our Savior could weep and yet have the foulness of joy as He faced the cross &lt;b&gt;(Heb 12.1,2)&lt;/b&gt;. Paul commands us to weep with those who weep &lt;b&gt;(Rom. 12;15),&lt;/b&gt; and yet to rejoice always. The Bible says that godly people are marked both by mourning (over sin, &lt;b&gt;Matt. 5:4; James 4:9; 5:1&lt;/b&gt;) and yet by irrepressible joy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Philippians 4:4&lt;/b&gt; is a commandment, repeated twice for emphasis, so that we will not shrug it off. It is a command that we must deliberately choose to obey, especially when were in difficult circumstances. It has to do with our attitude, which depends on our mental focus, which depends on our choice. The choice to rejoice often must go deliberately against how we feel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When we go through trials, when were treated unfairly, when were disappointed by people or circumstances, we are faced with a decision: Will we obey this command to rejoice in the Lord or will we allow ourselves to be swept along by our feelings?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Many Christians get depressed because they do not understand Gods purpose in trials or they do not mentally deal with their trials in the light of Gods Word. Often it can start with a simple disappointment--something you hoped would happen didntt happen. Someone you were counting on let you down. A situation you were hoping and praying for that did not come about. If you dont consciously yield your disappointment to the Lord thank Him by faith, trusting in His sovereign love, you can slip into depression. Satan often comes to you in a moment of disappointment and tempts you to doubt Gods loving care. Peter tells us to humble ourselves under Gods mighty hand, casting our cares on Him, and to resist the devil, firm in our faith, in such times of trial (&lt;b&gt;1 Pet. 5:5- 11&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Martyn Lloyd-Jones observed, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are many people who never know the joy of the Lord because they have failed to see themselves as miserable sinners. The only way to be happy in Christ is to be desperately unhappy without him&lt;/i&gt; (ibid., p. 148).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This has 2 applications. One is practical and another is eschatological.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word used here for moderation is translated &lt;i&gt;forbearance&lt;/i&gt; (NASB), &lt;i&gt;gentleness&lt;/i&gt; (NIV, NKJV), and unselfishness (Amplified).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Webster defines it as a refraining from the enforcement of something (as a debt, right, or obligation) that is due.Lightfoot calls it the opposite to a spirit of contention and self-seeking.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The word describes the person who has been transformed and softened by Gods grace and deals with others in the same manner. To be forbearing means that we will not be easily offended because self is not on the throne. Scripture tells us never to take vengeance when we are wronged, because that prerogative belongs to the Lord alone (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 12:19-20&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the focus of our lives is on ourselves, then when people hurt us, slight us, cross us, etc, there will be a desire to retaliate and get vengeance. Paul wants us to get the focus off of ourselves, and get it on others. When we adopt the mentality of self-love that is all around us, we will always look at the things people do and say as a personal attack. It will cause us to wear our feelings on our sleeves and to be more easily hurt by the words and actions of others. This will cause us problems in the mind as we dwell on what was done or what was said.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The reason that we are exhorted to exercise this non-retaliatory fruit of a The Spirit is because The Lord is at hand, in the sense of being near.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalms 145:18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The LORD [is] nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalms 46:1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;God [is] our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 7And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Greek word for careful here means to be anxious or worry. What is worry? The word refers to &lt;i&gt;a troubled state of mind resulting from concern about current or potential difficulties, whether real or imagined&lt;/i&gt;." It comes from an Old English word that means, &lt;i&gt;to strangle&lt;/i&gt;. It was used to refer to the practice of wolves killing sheep by biting them around the neck, thus strangling their prey to death. This is literally what worry does in your life. It will strangle you physically and spiritually. Worry will choke the life right out of you!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fret and worry indicate a lack of trust in Gods wisdom, sovereignty, or power. Beloved, the Great Physician Himself and the apostle Paul prescribe prayer as the solution to worry.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that Paul gave a complete picture of 4 different aspects of prayer by using four different Greek terms.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(1) &lt;b&gt;Prayer&lt;/b&gt; (proseuche) is used constantly in the New Testament of prayer in general. (2) &lt;b&gt;Supplication&lt;/b&gt; (deesis) concerns special times of need. (3) &lt;b&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/b&gt; (eucharistia) looks back to previous answers to prayer in which God helped in similar situations. All mercies received form God need to be accompanied with thanksgiving. (4) &lt;b&gt;Requests&lt;/b&gt; (aitemata) refers to specific requests for specific needs.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Paul says to make our requests known to God, the Greek word means &lt;i&gt;face to face with God&lt;/i&gt;, to come directly before Him. This means that when we pray, we must stop to remember that we are coming into the very presence of the holy God, where even the holy angels cover their faces and cry, &lt;b&gt;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (Isa. 6:3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This list describing the multi faced scope of prayer teaches us that even the smallest, apparently insignificant detail of daily life, as well as the large, momentous facts which confront them, should be brought to the attention of God. There is nothing too small for His consideration if it concerns the welfare of His children or of the Church.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A woman once asked the British Bible teacher, G. Campbell Morgan, &lt;i&gt;Do you think we should pray about the little things in our lives, or just the big things&lt;/i&gt;? He retorted, &lt;i&gt;Madam, can you think of anything in your life that is big to God&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And the peace of God which passeth all understanding&lt;/b&gt;The inseparable consequence of thus laying everything before God in prayer with thanksgiving is peace which is the dispeller of anxious care that comes from God, and rests in God (&lt;b&gt;John 14:27; 16:33; Col 3:15&lt;/b&gt;). Such peace passes or exceeds all mans notional powers of understanding. &lt;b&gt;John 14:27 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The apostle used a military term here: &lt;b&gt;keep&lt;/b&gt; here literally means &lt;i&gt;to garrison, to guard, to keep, to arbitrate, to umpire&lt;/i&gt; our hearts and minds. Since hearts (kardias) and minds (noun) suffer most at the lack of inner tranquility, God gives us the gift of prayer as a means to guard both.

&lt;b&gt;8 Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;True&lt;/b&gt;-that is to the truths of Scripture and the Gospel in opposition to falsehood, lying, and hypocrisy. Jesus called himself the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6), and He designated Gods Word as truth (John 17:17).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Honest&lt;/b&gt;-(semna) relates to things worthy of honor, or things worthy of reverence, as opposed to a flippancy that lacks seriousness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just&lt;/b&gt;-(dikaia) has to do with what is right according to Gods standard which is spelled out in the Scriptures;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pure&lt;/b&gt;-(hagna) means stainless or chaste and relates to things that encourage holiness.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lovely&lt;/b&gt;- (prosphile) refers to things that incite true love, rather than erotic behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good report &lt;/b&gt;-(euphema) relates to things that build faith and are attractive in character.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Virtue&lt;/b&gt;- Excellence; moral goodness. Valor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Think on these things&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Please note that Paul doesnt say to &lt;i&gt;think about thinking on these things&lt;/i&gt;! He says that we need to aggressively discipline our minds to meditate upon these things, turn them over in our minds, seriously consider them, and reason with ourselves about them, in order to put them into practice.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meditation in the realm of The Spirit is similar to digestion in the physical realm. These are the kinds of things that we need to think about and chew on day in and day out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How different would our lives be if we placed a post it note with this Scripture over our television, laptop, computer, smartphone, CD player at home or in our car and filtered whatever we watched, read or listened to through this filter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, a key to having a fruitful walk with Jesus relates to a persons thought life. Christians cannot enjoy Gods peace if they are always allowing unwholesome thoughts to fill their minds. Watch your thoughts, they become words; watch your words, they become actions; watch your actions, they become habits; watch your habits, they become character; watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verse 9 must not be separated from verse 8. Our thought life forms the basis for our behavior&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;These things which ye have both learned&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;these are the doctrinal things that they had learned from Pauls teaching and example.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Paul says, &lt;i&gt;Practice these things&lt;/i&gt;, the word implies doing something repeatedly until it becomes a habit or way of life. At first, habits feel awkward and unnatural. Remember the first time you ever drove a car with a stick shift? It seemed like there were a million things to remember and do all at once. But once you get it down, so that its a habit, you can hop in the car and drive off while discussing some fine point of theology with a friend, and you dont even think about what you are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Luke 4:16&lt;/b&gt; we read that Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and then it says, &lt;b&gt;and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath&lt;/b&gt; .... Jesus had a habit of spending the Sabbath with Gods people, worshiping God. We should have the same habit every Lords day. We should have the habit of reading Gods Word and praying each day. We should have the habit of avoiding things that pollute our minds. Habits come from practicing these things over and over. At first, when youre changing from ungodly practices to pleasing God, it may seem awkward. Keep at it, practice it until it becomes your routine.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And what is the promise given to those who put these truths into practice in light of the glorious gospel and out of a supreme love to please Christ? &lt;b&gt;The God of peace shall be with you&lt;/b&gt;God would give them a peace that would pass all understanding and enable them to stand strong in the faith and stand firm against the attacks of the enemy.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. 24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. (James 1.22-25).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is the one who builds his house upon the rock? The one who hears the Words of the Lord and does them. Who is the one who builds on the sand? The one who hears His Words but doesnt do them. One of the great dangers for we who love the Scriptures is to think hearing is equivalent to doing. You might say tonight, Yeah, I agree with the teaching Jesus gave on judging. I shouldnt judge. I need to show mercy. Right on. But if you leave here and immediately turn to someone and start gossiping or analyzing, judging or critiquing, youre foolish, and your house will collapse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We have such need to hear these words of Jesus because Bible students are in great danger of being foolish men who erroneously conclude that because they are hearing the truth and agreeing with the truth, they are automatically practicing the truth. The wise man not only hears Jesus words but also puts them into practice. And his house stands when the storm. comes. &lt;/i&gt;Jon Courson &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;Continuing in our Christmas Series, Pastor Ray shares from John Ch. 10 as Jesus reveals Himself as the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd comforts, cares for, and corrects His sheep. Are you one of His sheep? Do you hear His voice calling you? Jesus is the Good Shepherd, and He lays down His life for our sins, as King and Savior!&lt;/em&gt;

"But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."John 10: 2-4

A background knowledge of the Old Testament concerning the true shepherd of Israel is vital to a proper understanding of Who Jesus is proclaiming to be in John 10.

Almighty God appears throughout the Old Testament as the true shepherd of Israel:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Lord is my shepherd (Psalms 23:1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We are thy people and the sheep of thy pasture (Psalms 79:13).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock (Psalms 80:1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For He is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand (Psalms 95:7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The whole 34th chapter of Ezekiel is given over to this metaphor of God as the good shepherd and the false leaders as the evil shepherds. So what Jesus is saying here in John 6 is that He is Deity. He is The Shepherd that is spoken of in the Old Testament.&lt;!--more--&gt;

John 10
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.30 I and my Father are one.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
What Jesus is saying throughout the 4 gospels is that He is The seeking Shepherd Who is looking for sheep that go astray.
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/82027233"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Matt 9.36 But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Luke 19.10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 10.11 I am the good shepherd (lit. I am The Shepherd, The Good One) the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The atonement of Jesus is unlimited in the sense that Jesus is the propitiation for the sins of the world. (1 John 2.2). He is the Bread of Life sent from The Father to give life to the world (John 6.51).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Eph 5.2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The atonement of Jesus is particular in its efficacy in that it is only applied to His bride the church.

The atonement of Jesus is personal. Paul said Jesus loved him and gave Himself for him (Gal 2.20).
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The obvious contrast that Jesus is making here is between Himself, The Good Shepherd, and hirelings, or bad shepherds.

Hireling- Jesus uses this term to identify the religious leaders of the day (and any day for that matter) who perform their duty in good times but who never display sacrificial care for the sheep in times of danger. They stand in contrast to Jesus, who laid down his life for his flock

The wolf ... was Jesus' usual designation of false teachers (Matthew 7:15ff); but here it is used to describe the dangers and perils of shepherding. When a hireling sees danger coming, he will forsake the sheep and run away to protect himself.

Jesus, The Good Shepherd is not like that at all. As The Good Shepherd, Jesus gave His life for His sheep; Ps.22. As The Great Shepherd [He.13:20], Jesus cares for His sheep Ps.23. As The Chief Shepherd [1Pet.5:4], Jesus is coming again in glory and power.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isa 40.11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Pet 5.4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Verse 14 tells us that the Good Shepherd knows His sheep and that they know Him- That puts all of us today in one of two categories. You are either one of His sheep or you are not. To know Jesus Christ in a saving way means that you have a personal relationship with Him.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Tim 1.12 I know Whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 John 5.20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Old Testament often described Israels covenant relationship with God as knowing him, which meant having an intimate and obedient relationship with him (e.g., Jer 31:34; Hos 6:6).

This is a recurrent theme in John. Jesus acts and speaks out of His intimate relationship with the Father.

The surprising analogy in vv. 1415 is that the intimacy between Father and Son is compared to the intimacy between Son and followers (cf. 14:23). John focuses on the Hebrew connotation of know as intimate fellowship, not cognitive facts. Jesus knows the Father; those who know Jesus, know God!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Layeth down his life for his sheep ... What is this if not a prophecy of the cross? In the OT the sheep died for the shepherd; Christ is the Shepherd who dies for the sheep!

As an Old Testament believer, if you wanted to be enter into fellowship with God, you would bring a lamb to the temple. There, the priests would carefully inspect and scrutinize that lamb for any spot or blemish. It was not the worshiper who was judged. It was the lamb. In this lies a fabulous biblical and practical truth. As we learned in last post in this series, we can come boldly before the throne of grace to find mercy and grace to help in time of need because the Lamb has been inspected and found perfect. Worthy is the Lamb.

Jesus is not only the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world; He is the Good Shepherd Who lays down His life for His sheep.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus was speaking to the Jews, who had been frequently spoken of in Scripture as God's flock. The other sheep were Gentiles (cp. Isa 56.6-8).

One fold speaks of the one body of Christ made up of many sheep in many denominations. One Shepherd of course is The Lord Jesus Christ, that Great Shepherd of the sheep.

One fold, one Shepherd. Unity in the body of Christ is not our responsibilityits reality (Eph 2.11-16) Our responsibility is to maintain the unity of The Spirit in the bond of peace (Eph 4.1-3)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.17 Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.18 No man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of My Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Jesus repeated this phrase twice in these two verses indicating that his sacrificial death was not the end. Jesus resurrection was the singular sign and demonstration of His Messiah-ship and deity (Rom. 1:4). His death and resurrection resulted in his ultimate glorification (John 12:23 17:5) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (7:3739; cf. Acts 2:1639)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Luke 12.51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In one sense Jesus Christ is the most divisive person Who ever lived for the simple reason that you cannot be neutral about Him. You are either for Him or against Him.

You cannot be for Jesus and against His Word. For Jesus and embrace any other gospel. For Jesus and for Islam or for Hinduism or any other ism.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye Him?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.21 Others said, these are not the words of Him that hath a devil;. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication (Hanukkah) and it was winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The Jewish celebration of Hanukkah, which celebrates the Israelite victory over the Syrian leader Antiochus Epiphanes, who persecuted Israel. In c. 170 b. c. he conquered Jerusalem and desecrated the Jewish temple by setting up a pagan altar to displace the altar of God. Under the leadership of an old priest named Mattathias (his family name was called the Hasmoneans), the Jews fought guerrilla warfare (known as the Maccabean Revolt166142 b. c.) against Syria and freed the temple and the land from Syrian dominance until 63 b. c. when Rome (Pompey) took control of Palestine. It was in 164 b. c. on 25 Chislev (December approximately), that the Jews liberated the temple and rededicated it. The celebration is also known as the Feast of Lights because of the lighting of lamps and candles in Jewish homes to commemorate the event. (JMac Study Bible)
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.24 Then came the Jews round about Him, and said unto Him, How long dost Thou make us to doubt, if Thou be the Christ, tell us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
They did not want to know that Jesus was the Christ (Messiah) in order to embrace Him. They wanted Him to proclaim that He was the Messiah kin order that they might accuse Him of blasphemy and seek to kill Him, which we will see in a moment is exactly what happened.

There is always that frightening possibility when one stubbornly resists the call of Jesus Christ that maybe they are not one of His. Could that be you? Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in My Fathers Name, they bear witness of Me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10.26 But ye believe not, because ye are not on My sheep, as I said unto you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Cor 4.3,4 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And herein is a great mystery in the plan of salvation. Yes, we told to pray for the lost. Yes we are commanded to go into the entire world and preach the gospel, having our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.

But at the end of the day beloved, Jesus said in John 6.44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him and in John 6.65 no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

The desire to come to Jesus is a gift from God. The willingness to come to Jesus is a gift from God. The ability to come to Jesus is a gift from God. Blind men cannot make themselves see. Hearing impaired people cannot make themselves hear. Dead men do not walk out of caskets..salvation is a gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;John 10.27-31 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Then the Jews took up stones to stone Him.

My sheep hear My voice- Lets roll back to 1st century sheep &amp;amp; shepherds. At night flocks were brought to a sheepfold and committed to the care of the keeper/porter. In the morning the shepherds knocked at the barred door and the porter would open from within (or, sometimes the porter would sit in its entrance &amp;amp; become the door itself). Each shepherd would separate his sheep by giving a call. When summoned the flock would follow its shepherd because it knew its shepherds voice.

The majority of us have heard the Shepherd's voice. It is my prayer that many of you who have yet to come to Christ will hear Him calling you by His Spirit today.

I give unto them eternal life- Who but God could make a promise like this? The utmost security of those who have trusted in Christ alone for their salvation lies in the fact that no external power shall ever be able to dislodge them from the Master's love and protection.

The security of Jesus sheep rests with Him as the Good Shepherd, Who has the power to keep them safe. Neither thieves and robbers (vv. 1 8) nor the wolf (v. 12) can harm them.

Verse 29 makes clear that the Father ultimately stands behind the sheeps security, for no one is able to steal from God, who is in sovereign control of all things.

But lest we have a soft, easy believism" understanding of the message of human side of the atonement, it is cited elsewhere what the effect of the Jesus dying for us is to have upon our lives.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Titus 2.14 Who gave himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Peter 2.24 Who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Assurance must be balanced with perseverance. Assurance must be based on the character and actions of the Triune God.

The Gospel of John asserts the assurance of those who continue to put their faith in Christ. A truly born again person is an individual who is abiding in Christ. Continuing faith is the evidence of true salvation. Faith and trust in The Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation and cause of true salvation.

Salvation is not a product (life insurance, ticket to heaven), but a growing personal relationship with God through Christ.

I and My Father are one. One" here literally means "one in substance and nature." The claim that He and The Father are one, echoes the Shema, the basic confession of Judaism ( Dt 6:4 ) and amounts to a claim to deity. Jesus unity with the Father is later said to be the basis on which Jesus followers are to be unified ( Jn 17:22 ).

To stone Him- The blasphemer by judicial process of the Sanhedrim was to be stoned. Because Jesus was claiming equality with The Father by saying that He and The Father are one, He was guilty of blasphemy. In their own language, Jesus was making the claim of deity, which is why they took up stones to stone Him. Thus we have another proof text confirming the absolute deity of The Lord Jesus Christ.

Another time that they tried to stone Jesus was when He said in John 8.58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am (Ex 3.14).

One of the most beloved Psalms in the Bible is the 23rd Psalm: Listen to a breakdown of this Psalm and what it means for those who turn to Jesus as Savior and Lord. The Lord is my Shepherd - That's Relationship! I shall not want - That's Supply! He makes me to lie down in green pastures - That's Rest! He leads me beside the still waters - That's Refreshment! He restores my soul - That's Healing! He leads me in the paths of righteousness - That's Guidance! For His name sake - That's Purpose! Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death - That's Testing! I will fear no evil - That's Protection! For Thou art with me - That's Faithfulness! Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me - That's Discipline! Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies - That's Hope! Thou anoints my head with oil - That's Consecration! My cup runs over - That's Abundance! Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life - That's Blessing! And I will dwell in the house of the Lord - That's Security! Forever - That's Eternity!

Our consumer driven society has crept into the bloodstream of the church today. The essence of the gospel is not what Jesus will do for youits Who He is and what He has already done for you when He died for your sin. Because Jesus bore the wrath of God we deserved, our sins past, present, and future are forgiven in totality. Thus, the gospel is not, Come to Jesus so that you can buy a new car, or, Come to Jesus and you will not have any more problems in your life. The gospel is that we are hell deserving, self destructive sinners by nature and choice but God The Father in His rich mercy and grace for us sent His Son Jesus to pay the sin debt that I owed and absorb the wrath that I deserve in order that I could become one of His sheep and have fellowship with Him.

The gospel is "Come to Jesus right now!" because Jesus Christ died for your sins.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Pet 2.25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
While it is true that Jesus would call us in discipleship to take up our cross daily and follow Him, it is vital for us to remember that my entry into the presence of the Father is not based upon who I am, what I do, or what I dont do. It is based upon who He is, and what He did on the Cross. The Shepherd became a Lamb that we as His sheep might know the Shepherd.

Will you come to receive Christ as your Good Shepherd today?

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Mt 1:18 - Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In that culture, like many cultures today in that part of the world, the families of the bride and groom almost always arranged the marriages, often without consulting them. A contract was made and was sealed by payment of the dowry or bride price, which was paid by the groom or his family to the brides father.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Espoused is similar to what we call the engagement period in our culture. You and I would say that Joseph and Mary were in the engagement season of their relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This espousal period of time was around 1 year, and for all intents and purposes, the couple was legally married. The only part of the marriage that was not upheld was the actual cohabitation and sexual consummation of the union, which would be entered into &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the official ceremony.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It was during this period of time that you could actually divorce the person you were engaged to if they were found unfaithful during that period of time. So you can see the predicament that Joseph was in. Mary at this time is estimated to be between the ages of 14-16 years old.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Mary tells Joseph that she is pregnant, but do not worry, because she is still a virgin, put yourself in Josephs sandals. Imagine one of our 14-16 yr. old high school girls telling their parents, &lt;i&gt;Im pregnant, but its not what you think, its God&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of Luke gives us more revelation information about how Mary was found with child of The Holy Ghost.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lu 1:34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mt 1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put her away secretly- &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adopting the most private form of legal divorce, and handing the letter to her privately in presence of only two witnesses, to whom he need not communicate his reason&lt;/i&gt;s (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:154).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The penalty for adultery under Old Testament law was death by stoning, and this penalty applied to infidelity during betrothal as well (&lt;b&gt;Deut 22:23-24&lt;/b&gt;). The death penalty was rarely if ever executed for this offense.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It appears that Joseph was contemplating the custom of which Edersheim writes about.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mt 1:20 But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As Joseph is pondering what to do, an angel of The Lord tells Joseph that what Mary told him was true. He takes Mary as his lawfully wedded wife. The Incarnation, or Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, was a miracle that was prophesied right after the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. In fact, God speaks these words of the virgin birth to the serpent!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ge 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Biologically, the seed belongs to the man, and Marys impregnation by the Holy Spirit is the only instance in human history that a woman had a seed within her that did not come from a man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mt 1:21 "And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins." &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We can compare here &lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/?q=ps+130:8&amp;amp;t=en_nas&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psalms 130:8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; where it is said, and &lt;b&gt;He (YHWH) shall redeem Israel from all her iniquities&lt;/b&gt;. So Jesus is to act on behalf of YHWH as a Savior.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Here at the very commencement of the Gospel then we have the declared purpose of His coming. It is for the salvation of people from their sins. &lt;b&gt;He was manifested to take away our sins (1 John 3.5).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that Jesus came to &lt;b&gt;save His people from their sins. &lt;/b&gt;The &lt;b&gt;He&lt;/b&gt; is here emphaticHis Name implies His mission, and that is that He came to save&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;His people from their sins.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Jesus not only came to save us from the &lt;i&gt;debt&lt;/i&gt; of sin, but He came to deliver us from the &lt;i&gt;dominion&lt;/i&gt; of sin. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thou shalt call His name Jesus&lt;/b&gt;- The name&lt;b&gt; Jesus &lt;/b&gt;is Greek for the Hebrew name Joshua, which interpreted means, "&lt;i&gt;God is Salvation&lt;/i&gt;." It is a shortened form of, "Jehovah Shua" which means, "&lt;i&gt;Jehovah is Salvation&lt;/i&gt;." Thus Jesus Christ is the express image of:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jehovah jireh- The Lord will provide.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jehovah tsidekeneu- The Lord our rightousness.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jehovah rophe- The Lord our healer.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jehovah shalom- The Lord is our peace.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jehovah shammah- The ever-present Lord &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the OT, who was Joshua? The successor of Moses, the lawgiver.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;God did not give the law to the nation of Israel through Moses to save them from their sin, but to reveal their sin nature and point them to their need for a sin substitute to atone for their sin.&lt;b&gt; John 1.17 &lt;/b&gt;says, &lt;b&gt;The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth comes by Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The book of Hebrews clearly tells us that the entire OT system were types or Jesus Christ, the perfect high priest, the perfect sacrifice for sin, the perfect mediator between fallen man and God. The Holy Ghost tells us in Hebrews that the volume of the book (the entire OT) testifies of Jesus. That is what Jesus told the 2 disciples on the road to Emmaus in &lt;b&gt;Luke 24. &lt;/b&gt;That is what Jesus said in &lt;b&gt;John 5.39.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;22 So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: 23 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us."&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In 200 BC, seventy Jewish scholars translated the Old Testament into Greek and used a Greek word &lt;i&gt;parthenos &lt;/i&gt;in&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isa 7.14&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;that could only mean virgin&lt;/i&gt;. It describes a woman who has never known a man intimately. It would not be a sign or any miracle if a young woman conceived and bore a son, but a virgin bearing a son is a miracle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is no human father recorded in any account of the conception of Jesus in the womb of Mary. However, Jesus had to have one human parent or He could not have been human, and thereby a partaker of our flesh. Likewise, He also had to have divine parentage or He could not become a sinless and perfect sacrifice on our behalf.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Thus, the virgin birth is &lt;b&gt;the mystery of godliness&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3.16). For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily (Col 2.9). And The Word (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;being God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) was made flesh (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;became human&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;) and dwelt among us (John 1.14). &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As the NT life of Jesus develops, we see that during His ministry on earth, The Pharisees, not understanding the prophecies of the Virgin Birth, would accuse Jesus of being born of fornication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please note that the Name Jesus was given to convey the idea of &lt;b&gt;Emmanuel&lt;/b&gt;, which means, &lt;b&gt;God with us. &lt;/b&gt;Beloved, God is with you tonight. Another NT mystery is &lt;b&gt;Christ in you, the hope of glory (Col 1.27). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Oh the incredible humility of God our Savior, Son of God, Son of Man. 2 Sundays ago&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we saw how Jesus revealed Himself as The Good Shepherd during the Feast of Dedication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (John 10.22 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannukah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;). &lt;/strong&gt;The most common Jewish custom on Chanukah is lighting a special nine-branch menorah called a Chanukah. This special menorah differs from the seven-branch one that was in the Temple and is used only at Chanukah. Another key difference between the menorah and the Chanukah is that the eight candles on the Chanukah are kindled with special candle called a Shamash. The &lt;strong&gt;Shamash &lt;/strong&gt;is considered the &lt;strong&gt;servant candle&lt;/strong&gt; because it is used to light all the others.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus Christ, Emmanuel is not only our Savior, but He is Son of Man and Servant of all.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mr 10:45 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John 1:4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&lt;/b&gt; It is by grace, through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ, The Light of the world, that we receive the light of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mt 1:24 Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, 25 and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I realize that what these verses say might be considered offensive or even heretical to some of you here today, but what I am telling you is in the Bible.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;These verses prove that Mary was not a perpetual virgin.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The Greek word&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for &lt;b&gt;know&lt;/b&gt; here speaks of sexual intimacy. Joseph &lt;b&gt;did not know &lt;/b&gt;Mary physically &lt;i&gt;until&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;she &lt;/b&gt;gave birth to her &lt;b&gt;firstborn Son, &lt;/b&gt;Jesus.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In other words, Mary and Joseph did not officially consummate their marriage until after Jesus is born. The Roman Catholic doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary is not taught by the bible. Had there been any truth in the idea of her perpetual virginity, there can be no doubt that this would have been the point that would have been emphasized.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The clear implication of verse 18, &lt;b&gt;before they came together, &lt;/b&gt;and verse 25 which tells us that Joseph &lt;b&gt;did not know her till she brought forth her firstborn Son &lt;/b&gt;clearly teaches that Mary was a virgin only &lt;i&gt;until&lt;/i&gt; the birth of her firstborn Son Jesus.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is a list of Jesus siblings in &lt;b&gt;Matt 13.55; Mark 6.3. &lt;/b&gt;It was prophesied that Mary would have other children in&lt;b&gt; Psalms 69.8,9. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten Me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon Me. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Though Mary was declared by the angel to be highly favored and blessed among women, because she was the chosen vessel of God who would bring forth the miraculous conception; yet, in all other points, Mary stood upon the same footing with every child of GOD in the Covenant. And that Mary herself considered it as such, and looked for salvation, as all others of the redeemed do, in and by CHRIST, is evident from the song she sung upon the occasion: Mary said, My soul doth magnify the LORD, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my SAVIOR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
According to the totality of Scripture, it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that the divine purpose of the virgin birth of The Lord Jesus Christ was for the express purpose to make His soul an offering for sin?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christ was born to die for sinners is the good news of Christmas. But is not good news for you personally until you turn from your sin and receive Him as Savior and Lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Good News of Christmas is that Jesus Christ is Emmanuel Himself, God with us, our Savior and Lord. The Christmas story is a message of redemption. &lt;b&gt;Emmanuel shall save His people from their sin. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is by coming to Christ that we are given complete atonement, a free pardon, which delivers us from condemnation and the wrath to come and by which we are reconciled to God.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The greatest gift that any human being can receive this side of heaven is the miracle of the new birth. You receive that miracle of salvation by grace through faith in coming to Christ as Emmanuel, Savior and Lord. You come to Christ with your heart, for with the heart man believes unto righteousness.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</ns3:encoded>

		<title>Jesus: The Fountain of Living Water</title>

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;Have you drunk the "living water" yet? Are you still searching for that "missing link" in your life? Our souls crave spiritual satisfaction and the only remedy for the dryness within is Jesus Christ, the fountain of living water. There are many "wells" and "fountains" that people will drink from and go to, but they all leave us thirsty, parched, and broken. Jesus in John 4, meets a woman with a long line of broken relationships and sin, and reveals Himself as the Savior. In Christ, you will never thirst again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em"&gt;One of the wonderful things about the gospel of Jesus Christ is that it is the same message for all kinds of people. Old or young, rich or poor, well or sick, educated or uneducated, male or female, Jew or Gentile. The Scriptures plainly declare that Christ Jesus came into the world to die for sinners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/82552359"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
You can go to the highest halls of learning and talk with a man with multiple Ph.D.s. Although he is highly educated, the message he needs to hear is that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was raised from the dead, and that he can trust in Christ and receive eternal life as a free gift. You can take the same message to the most primitive, illiterate tribesman in some remote jungle and the message that he needs to hear is that Christ died for our sons according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried and rose again from the dead.

Nicodemus and the unnamed Samaritan woman are as different as they could be. He was a Jewish man; she was a Samaritan woman. He was educated and orthodox in the Jewish faith; she was uneducated and heterodox. He was an influential leader; she was a nobody. He was upper middle class; she was lower class. He was morally upright; she was immoral. Nicodemus was a religious wreck who knew he was empty inside and sought out Jesus. This woman was a moral wreck who could not fathom having anything to do with Jesus because she had been ostracized from society. But Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost.

Youve heard the story of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10? In John 4 we read the story of the Bad Samaritan!&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;b&gt;John 4.4-6 And he must needs go through Samaria. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;He must needs go through Samaria. Although the road through Samaria was the shortest route to Galilee, pious Jews avoided it. They avoided it because of the mutual disregard the Jews and Samaritans had for each other. This was the result of the overthrow of this region in 722 B.C. by the Assyrians. The Assyrians then removed the majority of the Jewish population and replaced them with foreigners. These foreigners intermarried with the remaining Jews, established their own religion, their own version of the scriptures, and their own temple on Mt. Gerizim. The Jews looked down on them for this and the Samaritans resented the Jews because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sychar. &lt;/b&gt;This place was the ancient Shechem, and Jacobs well was about a half mile outside of the city. It was forty miles north of Jerusalem, and was situated between Mount Gerizim (&lt;i&gt;the Samaritans holy mountain&lt;/i&gt;) and Mount Ebal, the Mounts of Blessing and Cursing (&lt;b&gt;Jos 8:30-35&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Here we find one of the many places in Scripture where the humanity of Jesus Christ is revealed. Jesus was fully God and fully man. Paul writes that Jesus was the fulness of The Godhead in bodily form. His Incarnation is the Mystery of godliness. His humanity enabled Him to "experience" our human frailties.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heb 2.17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The normal time for women to get water was either early morning or later in the afternoon, when it was cooler. The well was a place where women gathered to talk as they filled their water pots. We cant say for sure why this woman came to the well at noon, but it may be that because of her immoral life, that would cause her to be an outcast in society. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.7,8 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus asking the woman for a drink is a picture of how He thirsts for fellowship with us. This fellowship between The Lord and His people is so beautifully pictured in The Song of Solomon. Revealed elsewhere:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Cor 1.9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 John1.3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By tradition, a rabbi would not speak with a woman in public, even his own wife. It was also &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; unusual for a Jewish person of that time to ask a favor or accept a drink from a Samaritan's cup. Jesus' request genuinely surprised the woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How would this woman know that Jesus was a Jew? I believe that she knew that He was a Jew by the ribbon of blue that would have been worn around the border of His robe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Jews would not socialize with Samaritans. There was a saying used by some Jews at this time, &lt;i&gt;he who eats with a Samaritan is as he who eats swine flesh&lt;/i&gt;. Pastor Bob Caldwell.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This statement reveals the ethnic, religious, social, and national prejudices between these two people groups.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For Jesus to speak in public to this Samaritan woman who was a stranger in public was crossing two huge religious and ethnic taboos of His day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Note the word gift here. He wasn't selling this woman anything, He was offering to her living water. He will give her living water if she does what? Just asks! The Greek for the English &lt;i&gt;asked &lt;/i&gt;here means, "beg, call for, crave, desire." &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Scriptures declare that Jesus Himself declared that &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt; was The Gift from The Father in &lt;b&gt;John 3.16&lt;/b&gt; (cp &lt;b&gt;Isa 9.6 unto us a Son is given&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The significance of Jesus' offer as the source of living water is grounded in the O.T., where Yahweh is referred to as the fountain of living waters.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 2.13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jer 17.13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;John 7:37-39 &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Isa 44.3&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the living water is identified as the Holy Spirit, Who will dwell within those who turn to Him in repentance and faith.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus being the smitten Rock out of Whom rivers of living water flow (&lt;b&gt;Ex 17.6: Num 20.11&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs. 11,12 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?-- Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isnt it amazing how we so often out limitations on what Jesus can do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any physical experience or pleasure can never quench the spiritual thirst of man. Love, success, wealth, fame, food are &lt;b&gt;but a few &lt;/b&gt;of the &lt;b&gt;countless springs &lt;/b&gt;at which men drink and remain thirsty.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Imagine a handful of stickers that read &lt;i&gt;will thirst again!&lt;/i&gt; Now imagine taking those stickers with you and placing them on your dinner plates, on your TV set or computer screen. On the doors of every bar, pub, restaurant, health clubs, universities, seminaries, bottles of alcohol, joints, OTB tickets or a pipe; Or on the desk of the most successful business exec or pastor who has made it to the top... &lt;i&gt;you will thirst again!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Let's not miss here in verse 14 that this offer of living water is for &lt;i&gt;whosoever &lt;/i&gt;thirsts or hungers. Who here is a whosoever, will you please raise your hand?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The water that Jesus gives shall be &lt;i&gt;In him. &lt;/i&gt;Did you see that? This proves&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;that true Christianity is not primarily a matter of rituals and ceremonies, but rather an inward, personal relationship with the living God. It must be in each persons heart.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to thirst? It describes a person who has had no water to drink for days, and if they do not have something to drink they will die of dehydration. That is the idea in the following Psalms:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psa 42.2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psa 63.1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was a story, not a Christian one, but it illustrates the idea of the &lt;i&gt;degree &lt;/i&gt;of thirst or hunger for Jesus that we must have. A young man in India asked his guru how he could find God. The guru took him to the river, held his head beneath the water until the young man was kicking and swinging for his life. When the young man emerged from the water, the guru said, "When you were submerged under the water, what was the one thing that you desired more than anything?" The young man said, "Air." The guru said, "When you desire God as much as you desired that air, you will find Him."&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In &lt;b&gt;Psalm 27 &lt;/b&gt;David said &lt;b&gt;one thing I desire&lt;/b&gt;; In &lt;b&gt;Philippians 3&lt;/b&gt;, Paul said &lt;b&gt;one thing I do&lt;/b&gt;; in &lt;b&gt;Luke 10&lt;/b&gt;, Jesus told Mary that &lt;b&gt;one thing was needful&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The gift of eternal life is not simply something, it is more than religiosity, it is Someone&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev 21:6 I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Though Jesus Himself was weary and thirsty, He delayed refreshing himself in order that He might bring her who was spiritually dead, to the water of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.15-18 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband:in that saidst thou truly.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The woman wants this water. She realizes that she does not have it. But in verse 16, Jesus drops the sin bomb! Why did Jesus bring up such an embarrassing issue? Because the issue of her sinful life must be confronted. This woman had to decide what she loved more: her sin or the Messiah?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;With the rich young ruler, the issue of his heart was his money. With this woman, the issue was her immorality. According to Jesus, living together does not constitute marriage. In a day and age when more and more professing Christians are cohabitating because marriage is just a piece of paper, you need to know that you are at odds with Jesus.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is no conversion apart from confession and repentance of sin. You cannot come to Jesus if you intend to &lt;i&gt;hold on&lt;/i&gt; to sin. Grace is not a license to sin, it is deliverance from sins destructive grip and power over your life. The gospel message is not accept and receive, it is repent and believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.19,20 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain (&lt;/b&gt;My Gerizim&lt;b&gt;); and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mt. Gerizim is the place where the Samaritans worshipped. There is a synagogue today on the slopes of the mountain. The Samaritans had rewritten history to back up their differences with the Jews concerning their religion. They believed Mt. Gerizim was where Abraham had been willing to sacrifice Isaac, though in fact it was on Mt. Moriah in Jerusalem. They also taught that on Mt. Gerizim, Melchizedeck met Abraham (Gen. 14:18-20) and Moses built an altar.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This woman was tripped on the &lt;i&gt;location&lt;/i&gt; of worship. Jesus is going to correct her erroneous views by pointing to &lt;i&gt;Who &lt;/i&gt;you worship and &lt;i&gt;how. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The church, according to Scripture has 2 legs, eyes, and a heart; it isn't 4 walls.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Note that the woman worshiped there because "our fathers" did. The "fathers" were wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs 4.21-24 Jesus saith unto her, Woman (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;this word woman is a very tender term. It is the same word that we find in John 8 with another woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;), believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This hour has lasted for 2,000 years and continues today! Please note that The Father is looking for worshippers! Every child of God may not be called to be worship leaders, but every child of God &lt;i&gt;is called &lt;/i&gt;to be a worshipper!
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rom 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.&lt;i&gt; (worship:--(divine) service&lt;/i&gt;) 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The English word "worship" was originally spelled "worthship" and means to acknowledge the worth of the object worshiped. What does it mean to worship God in spirit and in truth?&lt;i&gt; It means t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;he &lt;b&gt;submission of all our nature &lt;/b&gt;to God;
Its the &lt;b&gt;quickening of conscience &lt;/b&gt;by His holiness; the &lt;b&gt;nourishment of mind &lt;/b&gt;with His truth; the &lt;b&gt;purifying of imagination &lt;/b&gt;by His beauty; the &lt;b&gt;opening of the heart &lt;/b&gt;to His love; the &lt;b&gt;surrender of will &lt;/b&gt;to His purpose. &lt;/i&gt;Pastor Brian Bell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs. 25,26 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am He.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Observe how this woman's view of Jesus progresses from calling him first a Jew (9); a Sir (11); greater than Jacob(12); a prophet(19); Messiah(25); Christ(29). That is how The Lord progressively reveals Himself to us..from the titles that this woman gave to Jesus, who is Jesus to you my friend?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The admission that Jesus makes, "I am he", is the declaration that He is The Messiah, the Christ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The gospel of Jesus Christ is about experiencing the presence and peace of God in this life as well as living forever with God in eternity. In the book of Revelation, we read about a great multitude who are martyred during the great tribulation period but who come out of that time clothed in robes of white because of the blood of the Lamb&lt;b&gt;..&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rev 7.14-17 These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Do you know the gift of God? Do you know that salvation is the gift of God? Do you know that eternal life is a gift? Do you know that God is not a merchantman seeking to bargain with people, but God is a Giver, offering everything freely?
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/?q=eph+2:8-9&amp;amp;t=en_nas&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 2:8-9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When we think of Christ as the Water of Life, our minds go to &lt;a href="https://www.studylight.org/desk/?q=isa+55:1-13&amp;amp;t=en_nas&amp;amp;sr=1"&gt;Isaiah 55:1-13&lt;/a&gt; , where the marvelous invitation is given: "&lt;b&gt;Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." &lt;/b&gt;He bids sinners to come and drink, will you come this morning?&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<ns3:encoded>&lt;em&gt;What challenges are you facing today? What future fears do you have? Are there mountains looming over you? There is only one way to endure, advance, and overcome these things in our lives: "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit says the Lord." Our strength is not found in our abilities, finances, or intellectual sharpness...it is found in the power of the Spirit. Be encouraged by this end of the year message from Pastor Ray, and be changed!&lt;/em&gt;

To understand our study, it is necessary that we first of all have a brief background of the time when the book of Zechariah was written and why.

The name Zechariah means, "The Lord remembers." The historical background and setting of Zechariah are the same as that of his contemporary, Haggai. Zechariah and Haggai began their ministries only two months apart (Hag 1:1) in the fall of 520 B.C. In 538 b. c., Cyrus the Persian freed the captives from Israel to resettle their homeland (cf. Ezra 1:14) and about 50,000 returned from Babylon. They immediately began to rebuild the temple (cf. Ezra 3:14:5), but opposition from neighbors, followed by indifference from within, caused the work to be abandoned (cf. Ezra 4:24).

Sixteen years later (cf. Ezra 5:12), Zechariah and Haggai were commissioned by the Lord to stir up the people to rebuild the temple. As a result, the temple was completed 4 years later in 516 B.C. (Ezra 6.15). Zechariah joined Haggai in rousing the people from their indifference, challenging them to resume the building of the temple.

But Zechariah was concerned with more than bricks and mortar. The fundamental issue was the covenant between the Lord and the Israelites. God would not be satisfied with just a rebuilt temple and city. He wanted a restored relationship. Because their ancestors had failed miserably in obeying the lawby not worshiping Him in spirit and in truth and by not acting justly toward one anotherGod called on the surrounding nations to punish His people. Now the question was whether the returnees had learned the hard lesson and would do any better at complying with the terms of the covenant.&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/82952559"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-202 alignright" alt="pastorraywatchwhite" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pastorraywatchwhite-300x252.png" width="300" height="252" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
4.1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As a man who is wakened out of his sleep: Zechariah had that woozy feeling that you get if you are awakened suddenly from a deep sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
4.2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:
4.3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God gave Zechariah a vision of the golden lamp stand that was meant to stand in the temple. Since Zechariah and his people were there to rebuild the temple, it made sense that God spoke to them in images related to the temple.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What did Zechariah see? This lamp stand was apparently similar to the lamp stand placed in Israels tabernacle (cf. Ex. 25:3140), and the 10 lamp stands of Solomons temple (1 Kings 7:49). The tabernacle lamp-stand had no reservoir and had to be filled with oil by the priests. One of the more tedious duties of the temple service was the constant care of the lamps on the golden lamp stand. They had to be continually refilled with oil, cleaned of soot, and their wicks had to be maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But this lamp stand was different! There were seven pipes to each of the seven lamps that were supernaturally filled with an endless supply of oil from the two olive trees on either side of the lamp stand.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What fed the lamp? Oil, which symbolizes the work of The Holy Spirit. What a beautiful picture this paints for us as a church family. Oil brings about lubrication and eliminates frictionjust as the fruit of the Spirit is love (Galatians 5:22). In addition to being a source of lubrication that eliminates friction and discord, oil brings about healing. Just as the Good Samaritan poured oil in the wounds of the man who had been beaten, James instructed the elders to anoint with oil those who were sick (5:14).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I also draw your attention to the fact that the vision is one that speaks of the perfection, completion, or fullness of God. 7 is the number of perfection in Scripture and it is found three times in the vision; seven lamps, seven pipes and seven eyes. This symbolism is divine assurance that the task of rebuilding the temple will be carried through to completion by the supply of Gods Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The 7-stemmed lamp stand is a type of the 7 churches, also called lamp stands in Revelation 1 of which Jesus is in their midst. Lord willing, we will see some amazing parallels between the divine empowerment that Zechariah needed to build the temple of God and great need of divine empowerment to do the work of The Lord today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
4.4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
4.5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What are these, my lord? Zechariah saw the vision, but didn't understand what it meant. What he saw was unusual but simple - a lampstand with lamps supplied with oil directly through pipes coming from two olive trees.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It was important for Zechariah to know the interpretation of this vision; because the meaning of the vision was that the work of rebuilding the temple and the moving of the mountain like obstacles before them could only be accomplished by the power of The Spirit of God and the abounding grace of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If we recall the historical background and the feebleness of the handful of discouraged men, the shortage of resources and the presence of the enemies round them, we can only imagine the sweetness encouragement that this promise of God towards them meant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The practical meaning of the vision is given here in verses 6 and 7. It is a vision of how Zerubbabel will accomplish the work: not by might. Nor by power, but by the Spirit of God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
4.6Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. 4.7 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who was Zerubabbal? Zerubbabel was the civic leader of Jerusalem and had the responsibility to finish the work of rebuilding the temple. The work had stalled, and Zerubbabel needed encouragement to carry on the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The task before him was filled with many obstacles. Fears, lack of resources and indifference. In symbolic language, he is told that he would be able to move mountains; but it would not be human power or human might that would move those mountains, but the power of The Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Though God uses human instruments to do His work, His intent is to negate any human claim to strength or might in accomplishing His work. Scripture declares, he who boasts, let him boast in The Lord. Jesus said, The flesh profits nothing (John 6.63).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When Paul said that he labored hard in ministry there in 1 Cor 15.10, he quickly inserted the fact that it was due to the grace of a God given unto him. Beloved, it is only by Gods gracious provision of His Spirit that any significant work is done in the kingdom of God.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;God does not accomplish His purposes on earth through our cleverness, or our programs, or any other natural abilities, but solely by His gracious Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! The work of rebuilding the temple was so massive it seemed like a great mountain. Here God promises that His Spirit will level that great mountain leveled into a plain with shoutings of grace.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shoutings of grace, grace. In other words, when the work of rebuilding the temple is accomplished, it will be declared that Gods favor was upon them. Whenever the work of God is done through human might or power, the attention and focus is on the human instrument, but when the work is done by the invisible but continual supply of the Spirit of God, then it is all to the glory of God's grace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
4.8 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
4.9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every promise made in the word of God will be fulfilled to the letter. In this case he who had begun the house should finish it, thus proving that a prophet had been among them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Human hands and human effort are most certainly used by God to accomplish His work, but the strength, grace and wisdom to do the work comes from God Himself in the gracious supply of His Spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
4.10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who hath despised the day of small things - It was a day of weakness, a day of small things; but they should not despise it, for it was the day of Jehovahs energy. Gods work always begins with little seeds. Alexander Maclaren&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;"Bible history is the record of God using small things. When God wanted to set the plan of salvation in motion, He started with a little baby named Isaac (Genesis 21). When He wanted to overthrow Egypt and set His people free, He used a baby's tears (Exodus 2:1-10). He used a shepherd boy and a sling to defeat a giant (1 Samuel 17) and a little lad's lunch to feed a multitude (John 6). He delivered the Apostle Paul from death by using a basket and a rope (Acts 9:23-25). Never despise the day of small things, for God is glorified in small things and uses them to accomplish great things." Wiersbe&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Cor 1.26-31 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My prayer is that The Spirit of God would cause us to have a simple, yet passionate love for Jesus and to see His glory manifested in and through our church family, in this community and around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The eyes of The Lord run to and from through all the earth. What is God looking for? For the eyes of The Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him (2 Chron 16.9).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Beloved, Gods work is not to be despised no matter how small it is. If it is Gods work it is important and significant. Dont be intimidated by the mega-ministry mentality. Dont be intimidated by what the world calls a waste. Precious saints, the things that we do today in the Name of The Lord and for the glory of The Lord have extremely long-ranging significance. It is often thought that what happens today is not really of nothing in the sight of God because they do not make front page news.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What you and I are doing as a church family here may be considered a small thing in the eye of the world but weve got to learn to take the divine viewpoint. I assure you beloved that God does not think in terms of big or small. He only thinks in terms of being faithful to Him&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For any of you who are reading this and have yet to embrace Jesus Christ as Lord. If there ever was a day when men despised the small thing that God was doing it was then. When the Son of God was crucified through weakness and hung there as the redeemer for our sins, nobody thought it was the day that it was at that time. Only a few bothered to stay and look. But there God was preeminently interested in that little hill out to the north of the city of Jerusalem. There all of the consummation of the ages was taking place. The greatest thing that has every happened in the universe happened at a place and at a time which was despised by almost all of the people of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Christ died for sinners. He died to pay for our sin debt. He rose from the dead to give us life. He bids you come and drink of His living water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Regarding our continual need to be filled with The Spirit of God if we are going to truly accomplish Gods will on earth as it is in heaven, as it is written in Ephesians 5.18,Vance Havner wrote, We say we depend on the Holy Spirit, but actually we are so wired up w/our own devices that if the fire does not fall from heaven, we can turn on a switch &amp;amp; produce false fire of our own. If there is no sound of a rushing wind, we have the furnace all set to blow hot air instead. God save us from a synthetic Pentecost!

This vision is a timely reminder for us as a church family as we draw near to the end of the year 2013. We may be drawing near to the end of the year, but the work of The Lord continues. The obstacles before us are great. God is looking for laborers in His harvest.

It has been said that God doesnt use people who are full of themselves, but people who are filled with The Spirit of God.

The great need of the church as we move into the year 2014, is not more programs, but people who are yielded and empowered by The Spirit of Jesus Christ.</ns3:encoded>

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join Pastor Ray Viola from Koinonia Fellowship for our introduction to the Book of Ephesians. Paul, called to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ starts this epistle with grace and will scale the heights of theological mountains and the pastures of practical daily Christian life as we proceed in this incredible book. Take comfort and courage in God's love and care for your life before you ever knew Him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left" align="center"&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs.1.1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The word apostle is an official title for Paul and the 12 disciples (including Matthias,&lt;b&gt; Acts 1:26), &lt;/b&gt;who were eyewitnesses of the resurrected Jesus and were chosen by God to lay the foundation for the church by preaching, teaching, and writing Scripture. Their ministry was accompanied by confirming signs, wonders and miracles through the power of The Holy Ghost.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lets review a bit of Pauls background, for I believe that it sets the stage for what we are about to study. Pauls given name was Saul. He was a Jew, born into the tribe of Benjamin, whose namesake was the first king of Israel. Paul was trained as a Pharisee under the famous rabbi, Gamaliel (&lt;b&gt;Acts 22:3&lt;/b&gt;). He was advancing in Judaism beyond many of his countrymen, being more extremely zealous for his ancestral traditions (&lt;b&gt;Gal. 1:14&lt;/b&gt;). He heartily approved and assisted when the Jewish leaders stoned Stephen to death. After that, Paul had ravaged the church, entering homes and dragging off both men and women to put in prison and put to death (&lt;b&gt;Acts 8:3; 9:1&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As he was on his way to Damascus to bring any Christians from that city bound to Jerusalem, God sovereignly intervened in Pauls life. A bright light from heaven suddenly blinded him. He fell to the ground and heard the Lord say &lt;b&gt;(Acts 9:4), Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&lt;/b&gt; When Paul responded, &lt;b&gt;Lord, who are You?&lt;/b&gt; the Lord said &lt;b&gt;(9:5-6), I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I believe it is safe to say that at this point in time, Paul was not dissatisfied with Judaism. He wasnt considering various religious alternatives. Rather, he was militantly opposed to Jesus Christ and the gospel when (as he puts it in &lt;b&gt;Gal. 1:15-16), God, who had set me apart even from my mothers womb and called me through His grace, was pleased to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In other words, Paul did not have anything to do with his dramatic conversion and his appointment as an apostle. Rather, it all happened by the sovereign will of God. Paul was fiercely op- posing God at the very moment that God literally stopped him in his tracks, blinded him physically, but opened his eyes spiritually to see the risen Savior. As an apostle, Paul was appointed and sent by God to preach the gospel especially to the Gentiles, whom he formerly despised with a passion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;While probably none of us have had such a dramatic conversion as Paul had, the truth of the matter is that if we know Christ as Savior and Lord today, we know that it was not our doing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each and every one of us born after the flesh, separated fro God and spiritually dead in our sins (&lt;b&gt;Eph. 2:1&lt;/b&gt;). Before our conversion, we were living in futility, darkened in our understanding, excluded from the life of God because of our ignorance and hardness of heart, given over to sensuality and impurity with greediness (&lt;b&gt;4:17-19&lt;/b&gt;). It was while we were in that lost and hopeless condition, that the glorious, transforming truth of &lt;b&gt;2:4-5&lt;/b&gt; broke into our lives: &lt;b&gt;But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved).... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The recipients of this letter were &lt;b&gt;the saints &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;faithful brethren in Christ Jesus. &lt;/b&gt;In other words, any person who has been gripped the grace of God through Christ and made a new creature.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saints-&lt;/b&gt;The word means, set apart ones, holy ones, or sanctified ones. Thus, to be a saint&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;means that we have been cleansed from all our guilt by Christs sacrifice on our behalf (&lt;b&gt;Heb. 10:10, 14&lt;/b&gt;). Thus we are separated from this evil world and set apart unto God for His holy purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faithful in Christ Jesus-&lt;/b&gt; Those who are walking in obedience to Christ, for to believe in Jesus is the same as being faithful to Him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vs. 1.2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grace and peace. Grace &lt;/b&gt;is Gods unmerited, undeserved favor for sinners through Jesus Christ.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The gospel or good news&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is that you come to God just as you are and receive everything from Him as His gift. That is the meaning of the word, grace. If you do anything to deserve it or earn it, it is not grace. Gods grace means that He justifies the ungodly, on the basis of faith alone, not works (&lt;b&gt;Rom. 4:4-5&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peace &lt;/b&gt;with God is our standing before God through faith in The Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;b&gt;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5.1). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This grace and peace is&lt;b&gt; from God The Father (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not the godfather&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;The conjunction and indicates equivalence; that is, the Lord Jesus Christ is equally divine with the Father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ephesians 1:3-14 &lt;/b&gt;comprises one long sentence in Greek, with three major sections. Each section ends with a note of praise for God &lt;b&gt;(vv. 6, 12, 14), &lt;/b&gt;focusing on a different member of the Trinity.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;

After an opening summary of all the saints 'spiritual blessings&lt;b&gt; (v. 3), &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;the first section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; (vv. 4- 6) &lt;/b&gt;offers up praise that the Father has chosen us in eternity past; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;the second section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; (vv. 7- 12) &lt;/b&gt;offers up praise that the Son has redeemed us in the historical past (i.e., at the cross); &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;the third section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt; (vv. 13- 14) &lt;/b&gt;offers up praise that the Holy Spirit has sealed us in our personal past, at the point of conversion.

Please keep in mind beloved that these incredible truths were not written to theologians or scholars but to common followers of Christ like you and me.

&lt;b&gt;Vs.1.3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. &lt;/b&gt;This incredible section of Scripture begins with praise and adoration being given to God The Father. When Jesus gave us a model for prayer, we learn of The Father, Hallowed be Thy Name. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 Peter 1.3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who has &lt;b&gt;blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&lt;/b&gt; Christ is the blessing of the gospel, and every one of Gods superabundant blessings are found &lt;b&gt;in Christ &lt;/b&gt;and only belong to those who are &lt;b&gt;in Christ&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jesus is the one and only mediator between the Father and us (&lt;b&gt;1 Tim. 2:5&lt;/b&gt;). All that we receive from God, we must receive through the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ becomes our heavenly Father when we come to Him through His Son.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
